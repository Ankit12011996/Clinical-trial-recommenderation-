2	Efficacy and Safety Study of Clozapine Augmented by Atomoxetine Versus Clozapine Augmented by Placebo in Patients With Chronic Resistant Schizophrenia, The purpose of this study is to scientifically explore the potential of pharmacogenetic applications as a means of predicting the clinical efficacy and safety of treatment with clozapine and atomoxetine in a treatment resistant schizophrenic population.||The principle enzyme involved in the metabolism of clozapine is CYP1A2 with minor contributions from CYP2D6. However, all the subjects will be on a stable dose of clozapine and will continue on the same dosage throughout the study. On the other hand, half the number of subjects will be randomized to augmentation with atomoxetine and since atomoxetine is predominantly metabolized by CYP2D6 with contributions from CYP2C19, we will focus on genetic variations for CYP2D6 and CYP2C19.||The goal of this study is to associate atomoxetine and metabolite drug concentrations with clinical efficacy and the development of any clinical adverse drug reactions and to determine whether clinical outcome (efficacy and ADRs) experienced following drug ingestion are more likely to be seen in patients who manifest CYP2D6 and/or CYP2C19 polymorphism(s).

2	"The Effects of Aripiprazole on the Processing of Rewards in Schizophrenia, TITLE: Aripiprazole effects on reward processing in deficit syndrome schizophrenia Principal Investigator: Erica Duncan, M.D.||Background- This is a study of the way people with schizophrenia may feel when they get rewards. Certain parts of the brain play a part in people feeling happy when they win some sort of reward or have a good thing happen to them. Some people with schizophrenia may have trouble feeling pleasure because part of their brains, the frontal cortex, may not work properly. We are doing this study to understand how the frontal cortex works in people with and without schizophrenia when they are trying to win a reward. We will use a special kind of brain scan called Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to show the brain working in action. fMRI scanning uses a big magnet to take special pictures of the brain.||A new medicine called aripiprazole has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treating symptoms of schizophrenia. This medicine has a new mechanism of action that helps neural functioning in the part of the brain that is involved with planning and goal setting. We think this new medication may help with brain processing of rewards. We are therefore studying the brain with fMRI scans before and during treatment with this aripiprazole.||Objective- The objective of this study is to determine whether subjects with negative symptoms of schizophrenia have abnormal functioning of brain circuits relevant to reward processing, and to determine whether any such abnormalities are normalized by treatment with aripiprazole.||Research Plan-Aim 1. Define impairments in the neural correlates of reward processing in primary deficit syndrome schizophrenics compared to normal controls.||Ten stable outpatients with primary deficit syndrome schizophrenia will be compared to ten normal controls in a BOLD contrast fMRI experiment constructed to assess in a parametric design the recruitment of reward circuitry in response to increasing monetary reward. We predict that frontal cortical areas important in reward processing such as the OFC and ACC will have reduced activation in the schizophrenic subjects.||Aim 2. Assess the ability of aripiprazole to normalize reward circuit functioning in deficit syndrome schizophrenia, and correlate fMRI changes with clinical changes in negative symptoms.||The ten schizophrenic subjects in Aim 1 will be switched from standard antipsychotic treatment to twelve weeks of open label aripiprazole and retested with the fMRI monetary reward task. We predict that twelve weeks of aripiprazole treatment will normalize the activation of OFC and ACC in response to monetary reward stimuli. We further predict that the degree of normalization in fMRI activation will correlate with negative symptom improvement on aripiprazole.||Methods- Up to 25 volunteers with schizophrenia and 25 volunteers without a psychiatric disorder will participate in this study at the Atlanta VA Medical Center. Subjects will first be interviewed about their medical and psychiatric history, and any current symptoms they are having. They will receive an fMRI scan during which they will play a computer game that rewards correct responses with money. This fMRI session will allow for the assessment of which parts of the brain are functioning during rewarding conditions. The results will be compared for subjects with and without schizophrenia.||The subjects with schizophrenia will have their antipsychotic medication tapered and switched to aripiprazole during a twelve week treatment phase. They will be seen at the end of Week 1, Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, Week 8, Week 10, and Week 12. At the last visit the fMRI scan will be repeated during the same reward task.||Clinical Relevance- The inability to experience pleasure and the inability to pursue goals is an important symptom of schizophrenia. These symptoms probably play a huge role in preventing many people with schizophrenia from leading full and fulfilling lives. A central defect in reward processing pathways in the brain may account for these symptoms. If aripiprazole can be demonstrated to improve functioning in these brain pathways, this would greatly advance our understanding of schizophrenia and could bring greater functioning to patients with schizophrenia.||Complete study Protocol:||ARIPIPRAZOLE EFFECTS ON REWARD PROCESSING IN DEFICIT SYNDROME SCHIZOPHRENIA||Principal Investigator: Erica Duncan, MD||Specific Aims||The chronic negative symptoms of schizophrenia remain poorly responsive to psychopharmacologic treatment. The impaired motivation of primary deficit syndrome patients prevents them from pursuing social and occupational goals and prevents them from developing meaningful and productive lives. This proposal is based on the test of a hypothesis that schizophrenic patients with enduring deficit symptoms suffer from impairments in reward processing and the translation of perceived reward salience into goal-oriented behavior. Preclinical and clinical research has revealed the functioning of a distributed neural network in the processing of reward stimuli. Regions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) such as orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) are key frontal cortical elements of a neural circuit that mediates reward salience, reward expectation, and reward approach behavior. Aripiprazole, in virtue of its' activity as a dopamine (DA) partial agonist, is uniquely suited to enhance functioning of these frontal areas crucial to reward processing. We hypothesize that primary deficit syndrome schizophrenia is associated with functional deficits in reward circuitry detectable by fMRI scanning during a monetary reward task. We further hypothesize that treatment with aripiprazole will normalize reward circuit function in these subjects and thus contribute to improvements in negative symptoms. The following specific aims will test these hypotheses:||Aim 1. Define impairments in the neural correlates of reward processing in primary deficit syndrome schizophrenics compared to normal controls.||Ten stable outpatients with primary deficit syndrome schizophrenia will be compared to ten normal controls in a BOLD contrast fMRI experiment constructed to assess in a parametric design the recruitment of reward circuitry in response to increasing monetary reward. We predict that frontal cortical areas important in reward processing such as the OFC and ACC will have reduced activation in the schizophrenic subjects.||Aim 2. Assess the ability of aripiprazole to normalize reward circuit functioning in deficit syndrome schizophrenia, and correlate fMRI changes with clinical changes in negative symptoms.||The ten schizophrenic subjects in Aim 1 will be switched from standard antipsychotic treatment to twelve weeks of open label aripiprazole and retested with the fMRI monetary reward task. We predict that twelve weeks of aripiprazole treatment will normalize the activation of OFC and ACC in response to monetary reward stimuli. We further predict that the degree of normalization in fMRI activation will correlate with negative symptom improvement on aripiprazole.||Background and Significance||Negative Symptoms as a Deficit in Reward Processing Antipsychotic medications are often able to relieve the positive symptoms of schizophrenia such as hallucinations, delusions, and disorganization. However the response of deficit symptoms to psychopharmacology remains disappointing. Many patients with minimal active psychotic symptoms are severely impaired in their functioning because of enduring deficit syndrome features.||A key component of the deficit syndrome is a lack of motivation to pursue goals in educational, occupational, social, and recreational domains. This proposal rests on the hypothesis that a core feature of the amotivational component of the deficit state is a deficiency in reward processing. This deficiency in turn fails to provide sufficient stimulation of conditioning reinforcement of approach behavior serving the pursuit of rewards. In most patients the impairment is not so severe that the patients fail to pursue the primary rewards of food and drink. But motivation to pursue more complex secondary reinforcers such as economic success, stable loving relationships, avocations, intellectual fulfillment and other uniquely human goals are strikingly lacking in deficit syndrome patients.||Frontal Cortical Hypofunction in Negative Symptoms Refinements in the DA hypothesis have emphasized an imbalance between mesocortical and subcortical/mesolimbic DA activity. Hyperactivity of the mesolimbic DA system has been implicated in the positive symptoms of the illness; hypofunctioning of the mesocortical DA pathway has been implicated in the pathophysiology of negative symptoms (Weinberger 1987; Davis et al.1991). The finding of neurophysiologic hypofunction of the frontal cortex during cognitive activation studies in schizophrenic subjects has given rise to the concept of hypofrontality (Weinberger et al. 1986; Berman et al. 1986; for review see Weinberger et al. 1994). Furthermore, frontal hypofunction has been linked specifically to negative symptoms irrespective of the severity of positive symptoms in unmedicated schizophrenics (Wolkin et al. 1992).||Neural Circuitry of Reward Processing Research into the neural correlates of reward processing indicates the importance of midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons and distributed reward circuits to the coding of reward anticipation and salience, and the translation of motivation into approach behavior. Key structures that have been implicated in reward processing on the basis of animal studies include DA neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra and their target areas such as the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), amygdala, and OFC (Wise 1980; Wise and Hoffman 1992; Koob 1992; Robbins and Everitt 1996; see Schultz 2000, 2001 for review). Circuitry linking these areas is hypothesized to mediate several aspects of reward processing such as the detection of primary or secondary reward stimuli, prediction of expected future rewards, and the use of information to control goal-directed or motivated behavior (Schultz 2000). Recently developed methods are being used to study the reward pathways in normal humans and subjects with substance abuse disorders in the fMRI environment. These studies implicate the mesocorticolimbic DA system and functionally connected areas: OFC, ACC, dorsolateral PFC, amygdala, NAcc, and insula (Grant et al. 1996; Childress et al. 1999; Maas et al. 1998; Garavan et al. 2000; Kilts et al. 2001; Wexler et al. 2001). fMRI paradigms using money as a secondary reinforcer reveal activations in many of these same areas: amygdala, NAcc, ventral striatum, and areas of PFC (Thut et al. 1997; Elliott et al. 2000; Elliott et al. 2003). The fact that very similar areas are activated by primary reinforcer paradigms in animal studies, drug cue studies in substance abusers, and monetary reward paradigms in normal controls suggests that the study of monetary reward processing is a valid strategy to assess the integrity of reward circuitry in experimental paradigms.||Overlap of Reward Circuitry and Areas Implicated in Negative Symptoms As indicated above, dopaminergic hypofunction in the PFC is strongly implicated in the pathophysiology of negative symptoms. The presentation of reward or stimuli that predict reward stimulates the phasic activation of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain (Shultz 2000) that innervate the PFC. Hence there is a critical overlap of circuitry implicated in negative symptoms and circuitry that subserves reward processing. This overlap supports the use of reward paradigms to explore the functional integrity of mesocortical DA inputs and PFC function.||Aripiprazole and Negative Symptoms The novel antipsychotic, aripiprazole, has a unique pharmacological mechanism of action that makes it potentially unique for the amelioration of negative symptoms. Aripiprazole is thought to increase DA activity in the PFC by virtue of its' activity as a partial agonist at post-synaptic DA2 receptors (Burris et al. 2002). We hypothesize that treatment with aripiprazole will normalize the function of PFC reward circuitry through increased DA functioning in frontal cortical regions (OFC, ACC) that subserve reward processing.||Potential Importance of Proposal for Treatment Indications of Aripiprazole The severe impairment of motivated behavior in patients with deficit syndrome schizophrenia is strongly suggestive of an abnormality in the neural circuits that mediate reward processing and the translation of reward salience to motivated behavior. To date there are no published fMRI studies of the functioning of reward circuits in subjects with deficit syndrome schizophrenia. We hypothesize that negative symptom schizophrenics will exhibit impaired fMRI estimated activation of reward circuitry compared to normal controls, and that aripiprazole treatment will normalize functioning of this circuitry.||The demonstration of improvements in negative symptoms in medication trials has been elusive. Even an agent capable of improving reward processing might not produce detectable decreases in rating scales designed to measure negative symptoms over the short term. This is because patients with chronic deficit states have compromised functioning due to the cumulative effects of social and occupational dysfunction. In patients such as these, the normalization of reward processing circuits by a medication such as aripiprazole would only be the first step. These patients are likely to require considerable psychosocial rehabilitation to recoup occupational and social functioning and achieve meaningful gains in negative symptom rating scales. However, normalization of reward circuitry function would strongly suggest that aripiprazole has potential to improve chronic negative symptoms when combined with a supporting rehabilitative program. Significant changes in reward circuit function would also strongly support the early intervention potential for aripiprazole to prevent chronic deterioration in function if first break patients were treated with this agent early in their course.||Materials and Methods||Subjects Ten male schizophrenic subjects ages 18-60 will be recruited. Diagnosis will be confirmed by structured diagnostic interview (SCID-I). Primary deficit syndrome will be confirmed by rating with the Schedule for the Deficit Syndrome (SDS), a scale that defines schizophrenic subjects according to whether they have chronic negative symptoms even across periods when positive symptoms are in remission (Kirkpatrick et al. 1989). This scale thus allows for the differentiation of those patients who have negative symptoms consistently across clinical states from those whose negative symptoms emerge when they are acutely psychotic and remit when positive symptoms remit. Additionally, subjects must have a minimum score of 30 on the SANS. Subjects will be excluded for clinically significant unstable medical illness, history of neurological disease including head trauma with loss of consciousness >5 minutes, active substance abuse or dependence within the prior three months, any contraindication to fMRI, left handedness, mental retardation, color blindness, antipsychotic treatment resistance, or known allergy to or nonresponse to aripiprazole. Subjects with schizophrenia will be excluded if they do not have a working telephone.||Ten male normal comparison subjects will recruited, matched in mean age and ethnicity to the schizophrenic group. Absence of psychopathology will be confirmed by SCID-I, NP version. Subjects will be excluded for clinically significant unstable medical illness, history of neurological disease including head trauma with loss of consciousness >5 minutes, active substance abuse or dependence within the prior three months, any contraindication to fMRI, left handedness, color blindness, or mental retardation. Normal controls will be matched to schizophrenic subjects with regard to monthly income so that monetary rewards during the task will have comparable reinforcement value.||Baseline Assessment Prior to fMRI scanning all subjects will be assessed for smoking status by means of the Fagerstrom Smoking Tolerance Questionnaire (Fagerstrom 1978) and nicotine dependent subjects will be instructed to smoke their usual amount prior to reporting for scanning. Screening for intact vision (≥ 20/25 uncorrected or corrected with eyeglasses or contact lenses) by means an eye chart will be conducted. Cognitive status will be assessed in the following domains: attention (Continuous Performance Test), psychomotor reaction time (finger tapping test), memory (California Verbal Learning Test), IQ (Weschler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence, vocabulary and matrices subtests), and executive function (Stroop Task). The schizophrenic subjects will be rated for severity of psychopathology by means of the PANSS, Abrams and Taylor Rating Scale for Emotional Blunting (A&T), SANS, Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI), and the Quality of Life Scale. Current side effects to antipsychotics will be assessed by means of the Barnes Akathisia Scale and the Simpson Angus Scale. Schizophrenic subjects will have 30cc of blood drawn for CBC and SMA-12 to ensure stable baseline medical status prior to switching to aripiprazole.||Cognitive Task Meaningful comparisons of schizophrenic and non-schizophrenic subjects by a cognitive task necessitates the use of a simple task to minimize confounds related to group differences in cognitive ability. A parametric manipulation of reward contingency will control for group differences in task performance. The proposed monetary incentive task, adapted from that of Elliott et al. (2003), is chosen because of its simplicity and parametric design. The subjects will be given a simple target detection task in which they will be instructed to squeeze a response bulb when they see a red or blue square. Different colored squares will be presented on a screen for 1.3 sec each. When they correctly signal the target stimuli they will see a reward stimulus informing them of how much money they have won on that trial. For trials with non-targets (paying no reward if the subject squeezes the bulb) the subjects will see a neutral text telling them to wait. The reward amounts will vary from 5¢ to $1 per trial (5¢, 25¢, 50¢, 75¢, or $1). The task will be divided into five blocks separated by 30 sec rest periods. Each block will contain 40 trials. Trial types will be presented in randomized order within each block: 30% of trials will contain one of the two target stimuli. Each block will pay correct responses at one of the five monetary reward levels. The task is designed specifically to allow for both an ""on-off"" assessment of activations in the presence or absence of reward, but also for a parametric analysis of brain areas that increase their activation with increased reward levels. The subjects will be told that their payment for participation in the fMRI scan will be the total money they accumulate by correct responses during the task. This latter point is important in that the money won during task performance has a real world salience more likely to enhance reward-related activations than if all subjects automatically were paid the same amount regardless of their accuracy. Thus the subjects receive actual rather than simulated reward.||fMRI Scanning Blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI scanning will be performed on a research dedicated Siemens 3T whole body MRI scanner located in the Emory Hospital MRI Center. Foam padding will be used to restrict the subjects' head motion within the magnet. 30 axial slices of 3 mm thickness will be acquired parallel to the AC-PC line with a matrix size of 64 x 64 over a field of view of 22 x 22 cm, using a TE of 30 msec. With this protocol we have successfully imaged the orbitofrontal cortex with minimal magnetic susceptibility artifacts. The functional images will be obtained using a T2* weighted spiral-scan pulse sequence (TR 3000 msec, TE 25 msec, flip angle 60 deg). High resolution anatomical T1-weighted MR images will be acquired for localization of task-related neural activations (TR =10 msec, TE = 4.5 msec, TI=900 msec, FOV=24 cm, 256 x 256 matrix, contiguous 3 mm slices covering the whole brain).||Aripiprazole Treatment After receiving the first scan, the schizophrenic subjects will be started on open label aripiprazole 15 mg po qd. Over the subsequent six weeks they will be titrated to a target dose of 30 mg po qd and maintained on this dose for the next six weeks. The aripiprazole titration schedule will be as follows: 15 mg Weeks 1-2, 20 mg Weeks 3-6, and then 30 mg. During the first six weeks of the treatment phase their prior antipsychotic will be gradually tapered down (75% of total daily dose in Week 1 and 2, 50% of total daily dose in Weeks 3 and 4, 25% of total daily dose in Week 5 and 6) and then discontinued.||The subjects will be brought in for study visits at the end of Week 1, Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, and Week 8, Week 10, and Week 12. At each study visit they will be rated with the PANSS, SANS, CGI, and A&T. Extrapyramidal side effects and akathisia will be rated with the Simpson Angus Scale and the Barnes Akathisia Scale respectively. The Quality of Life Scale, the CVLT, CPT, and Stroop Test will be repeated at the end of Week 12.||Stopping Rules for Subjects with Schizophrenia There is a risk of symptom exacerbation when antipsychotic medication is switched. For this reason, several safeguards will be put into place.||Subjects will be excluded if they have a history of suicidal, or assaultive behavior during psychotic decompensations.|The subjects will be given a cross-titration whereby their prior antipsychotic medication is gradually tapered over six weeks while aripiprazole is being titrated to maximum dose.|Subjects in the schizophrenia group will be closely monitored during the treatment phase. They will be given reminder calls the day before each study visit. If they do not come for a scheduled visit, the study staff will call and reschedule for the soonest day they can come in. Subjects without a working telephone will be excluded.|At each visit subjects will be rated with the CGI. If the CGI Global Improvement Scale is rated 6 (Much Worse) or 7 (Very Much Worse) at any visit, they will be dropped from the study and their previous antipsychotic will be resumed at the dose prior to enrollment.||fMRI Image Analysis Imaging data will be analyzed by means of MATLAB and statistical parametric mapping software (SPM99). The images will be resliced and corrected for motion by registration to the first functional image acquired for each subject using a 6 parameter transformation (Friston et al 1995). Images will be spatially normalized to a Montreal Neurological Institute template. A high-pass filter will be used to remove low frequency noise. Image smoothing using a 6 mm Gaussian kernel will be used to enhance signal-to-noise ratios and accommodate differences in neuroanatomy to facilitate group comparisons. The delayed cerebral blood flow response to activation conditions will be modeled using the standard hemodynamic response function. Statistical analysis will proceed using a random effects model to examine outcomes of the parametric design of the experiment (Buchel et al. 1998). We will model both linear and nonlinear hemodynamic responses in regions of interest: Nacc, amygdala, striatum, thalamus, OFC, ACC, and hippocampus.||Analysis of Behavioral Data For Aim 1, cognitive data will be analyzed with a between subjects MANOVA to compare neurocognitive results between schizophrenics and normal controls. For Aim 2, behavioral rating scale data and repeated cognitive test scores (for CVLT, Stroop Test, CPT) will be analyzed with a repeated measures MANOVA model using timepoint as a within subjects factor.||References||Berman KF, Zec RF, Weinberger DR (1986) Physiologic dysfunction of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in schizophrenia.

0	The Effect of Acupressure on the Anxiety Level, Methods: In the study, 52 senior nursing students were randomly assigned to the study and control groups. The study group (n = 26) included Shen Men, the 7th acupuncture point (HT7) of the heart meridian located between the ulna and pisiform bones on the radial side of the flexor carpi ulnaris tendon, EX-HN3 (Yintang) located in the middle of the beginning of both eyebrows and the thumb and the LI4 points located in the space between the index finger (between the 1st and 2nd metacarpal bones of the hand, in the middle of the 2nd metacarpal bone on the radial side) will be applied for an average of 10 minutes. No intervention will be made to the control group (n = 26). In order to avoid ethical problems, both groups will be given an informative training on acupressure and anxiety content at the end of the study. The primary outcome of the study is the effect of acupressure on the state anxiety level of senior nursing students. The secondary outcome of the study is the effect of acupressure on trait anxiety level in senior nursing students. The results will be collected before the acupressure and in the 4th week of the last intervention., Acupressure|Nursing students|Anxiety|COVID-19

2	Minocycline Augmentation in Schizophrenia, Minocycline, which is a second-generation tetracycline, has been found to inhibit Nitric Oxide Synthase (NOS) and inflammatory cytokines. These are some of the primary mechanisms that have been proposed to explain its neuroprotective and neuroplastic effects in several animal and human models of neurological and psychiatric diseases, including Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. There are only three clinical trials with minocycline in schizophrenia subjects. A more definitive clinical trial in a larger sample with optimized and cost-effective design using a comprehensive cognitive battery and a global assessment of schizophrenia symptom domains is necessary to examine the efficacy of minocycline. If minocycline improves psychopathology and potentially other symptoms (including cognitive function) for schizophrenia, the treatment could be easily implemented in the existing treatment delivery system at relatively low cost and have the potential for making a significant public health impact. The investigators plan to recruit 120 individuals with early course schizophrenia who are currently on second-generation antipsychotic (SGA) medications and are experiencing persistent symptoms in at least the moderate range. In an effort to limit placebo response, which is notoriously high in psychiatric population, the investigators are using an adaptive design. Since, there is growing evidence to support the inflammatory hypothesis of schizophrenia, the investigators will also explore whether cytokine levels mediate the response from minocycline treatment., minocycline, augmentation, schizophrenia

0	Play Interventions to Reduce Anxiety and Negative Emotions in Hospitalized Children, This study tested the effectiveness of play interventions to reduce anxiety and negative emotions in hospitalized children.||Intervention||Placebo control group||In the control group, children received standard medical and nursing care, such as vital signs observation, pharmacological treatment and wound and pain management.||Experimental group||In the experimental group, participants received around 30 minutes of hospital play interventions each day, conducted by hospital play specialists. The interventions in this study consisted of structured and non-structured activities. All these activities were given at the patients' bedside, with or without parental supervision, either once or spreading over an hour, depending on the ward routine.||Data Collection Methods||Approval for the study was obtained from the hospital ethics committees. A research assistant collected demographic data from the parents and from the children's medical records after obtaining the consent form. The children's baseline anxiety levels were also documented. For the experimental group, the interventions started after the baseline data had been collected. The emotional behaviour of each child was observed by a research assistant for two consecutive days, at the end of which a research assistant documented the child's overall emotional behaviour, using the CEMS. The child's anxiety levels were reassessed and documented.||Analysis||The Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) software, version 20.0 for Windows was used for the data analysis. Descriptive statistics were used to calculate the means, standard deviations, and ranges of the scores on the various scales. The homogeneity of the two groups was examined using inferential statistics (independent t-test and chi-squared). The interrelationships among the scores on the different scales and the demographic variables were assessed using the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient. Differences in the mean scores on the CEMS and the children's anxiety levels between the two intervention groups were investigated by an independent t-test and mixed between-within subjects ANOVA, respectively. Multiple regression analysis was performed to examine the effects of participants' demographic and clinical characteristics on the outcome measures., 0

0	Exploring the Effectiveness of a Brief CBT Intervention for Anxious Pregnant Women, This study is a prospective matched cohort design with follow up. The treatment group will consist of women who attend once to a one off 3 hour brief cognitive behavioural therapy treatment (CBT) session. Outcome measures will be completed at 3 time points, baseline, 2 weeks post intervention and 2 weeks' post partum (follow up).||A previously published dataset collected locally will be used as a control group. This dataset includes 120 sets of data who have completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) which will be the primary outcome measure for this study. Furthermore, the dataset includes data on several key variables including age, current pregnancy information, past pregnancy information, family and partner support available, medical support/input, income, education, living circumstances and future plan. These will be matched at key variables which are predictors of anxiety during pregnancy and might otherwise be expected to influence scores on outcome variables and utilised as covariates. The outcome measures will be completed at the same time points follow up, 2 months' post partum.||As part of a preexisting maternity care system, women are routinely offered a stress reduction session by their community midwives. Those who wish to attend are routinely placed on a database. For the purpose of this research, everyone who has been put forward for the group will be sent a covering letter, personal Information sheet (PIS) and screening HADS by the lead clinician (Mo Tabib - midwife). Participants who express an interest will be invited to have a telephone consultation with the chief Investigator. During this telephone call, eligibility will be discussed ad if appropriate telephone consent will be sought. Following this, those who do not meet eligibility criteria will be invited to attend the session as planned at Aberdeen Maternity Hospital and continue with their maternity care as usual. Eligible participants will be sent a pack of baseline measures as well as a consent form. Participants will have the option of returning these in a pre paid envelope or deposit in a confidential box at the session. Consent will also be sought for access to online medical records and consent to contact participants following the group by phone/text/email as reminder. Participants will be emailed two weeks following the session as a reminder to complete second set of measures. Participants will identify three areas which they will commit to practice following the session. The chief investigator will track their delivery date using using an online care system; 2 months' post-partum they will receive a further reminder text to complete final questionnaire set.||The chief researcher will seek informed, telephone consent initially, which can be withdrawn at any time. Consent will be discussed with potential participants during a telephone consultation following being sent the PIS and screening tool. If potential participants are interested and eligible the chief researcher will send out a consent form by means of written consent where participants will be offered choice of returning in post or deposit in a confidential box at the session. It will be highlighted that participants can withdraw from the study at any point., 0
0	"Using Smartphones to Enhance the Treatment of Childhood Anxiety, Boys and girls between the ages of 9-14 who have anxiety and a parent or caregiver are being asked to participate in this study. Interested participants who contact the study will be asked to undergo a brief phone pre-screen to determine initial eligibility.||After completing a phone pre-screen, potential participants for the Phase 2 trial will be invited to the lab to complete a clinical intake interview. Clinical information will be obtained from parent and child by a trained research staff member. The research staff member will have specific training to a high degree of reliability in conducting the diagnostic interviews relevant to this research study.||Participants that meet study criteria based on the clinical information obtained at the first study visit will be invited to begin a course of Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT), an empirically validated talk therapy commonly used to treat children with anxiety. Children will receive individual treatment using the Brief Coping Cat Manual. The Coping Cat program (Kendall 1994) is an empirically supported child-focused CBT treatment for children with anxiety disorders. Throughout the program, children are encouraged to practice techniques learned during therapy sessions through homework or ""Show-That-I-Can"" (STIC) tasks. Parents attend weekly check-ins and two parent-only sessions. STIC tasks will consist of specific SmartCAT modules in the smartphone app as assigned at the end of each session. Participants might be asked to interact with other children and adolescents or study staff as well as leave the therapy building. This is to allow participants to become more comfortable in situations that make them feel anxious by gradually exposing them to the specific situation. Parents are not treated as co-clients, but are considered consultants to the child's treatment and are asked to provide some collaboration and assistance in exposure planning and homework.||Treatment will be delivered by Masters-level therapists who will have completed training in CBT. They will attend a weekly supervision session with Dr. Silk, with consultation from Dr. Kendall on difficult cases via videoconference. All sessions will be videotaped.||SMARTPHONE PROTOCOL:||Prior to the first therapy session, the child and a parent will be trained how to use the SmartCAT app. Youth will be provided with an Android smartphone for the duration of the study. If the child already has an Android phone, the app will be installed on the participant's phone in order to decrease participant burden of carrying an additional phone.||Participants will be given a study-provided, pre-programmed smartphone on which they will enter their responses to a series of questions about moods and daily experiences using an app developed for this study. The child will receive an electronic notification message once per day and will be prompted through a series of questions about what he/she is doing, who he/she is with, how he/she is feeling, worries or stressful events, and how he/she coped with these events. It should take the child approximately 5 minutes each time to complete the questions. The child will only be prompted to answer these questions outside of school hours and on weekends. Participant data will be securely sent to study therapists via a clinician portal connected to the app to be reviewed weekly. The therapists may then integrate this information into treatment and provide customized feedback to the patient.||Parents will be asked to complete an online diary to keep track of what skills their child uses during the week. After completion of the initial screening visit, parents are asked to complete the Skills Use Diary daily for seven days. After this seven day period, they will be asked to complete a diary entry twice per week throughout 8 weeks of treatment, totaling 30 entries. At the end of treatment, subjects will again be asked to complete the diary daily for another seven days. Participants will receive links to the online diary and instructions for completion via email (see references and other attachments for the email script). Diaries should take no longer than 10 min per day to complete. The data will be encrypted and stored securely through the online survey system Qualtrics.||POST-TREATMENT and 2-MONTH FOLLOW-UP:||All clinical, skill acquisition, and skill utilization measures (including the parent 7 day diary) will be repeated at post-treatment (approximately 10 weeks) and 2 month follow-up We will use Qualtrics, a secure internet data collection system, for administering diaries and questionnaires., child anxiety|worries|fears|talk therapy"

0	Evaluation of a Cardiac Coherence Session to Reducing Patients' Anxiety During a MRI Examination, Although Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is considered to be biologically safe and painless, the examination is often perceived by patients as difficult to bear, causing a great deal of anxiety due to the various constraints: the upper half of the body, including the head, positioned in a tube with a circumference of approximately 70 cm, relatively long duration, immobilization and even restraint. However, all these conditions are necessary to obtain good quality images, which are essential for the interpretation of the examination for diagnostic purposes by the clinicians.||The anxiety of patients linked to the performance of an MRI examination and its negative effects are documented in the literature. According to some authors, 71% of the professionals surveyed stated that anxiety was a common problem in their MRI centre and 19% stated that it regularly disrupted the examination. It is estimated that 10% of the motion artefacts present on MRI examinations are caused by anxiety-related motor agitation, making image quality difficult to exploit. Thus, every day, many MRI examinations are cancelled, interrupted, or of poor quality due to movement and difficult to interpret. All these examinations must therefore be rescheduled, with delays that can be several months long.||Among these non-drug methods, cardiac coherence seems promising. This method is recent, non-invasive, of short duration, very easy to implement and requires little training for users.||The present study hypothesize that a single session of cardiac coherence, carried out in patients prior to an MRI examination and presenting anxiety in relation to this examination, could make it possible to reduce their level of anxiety and thus improve the course of the examination., cardiac coherence|improving patient management
2	Role of Vitamin D Supplementation in Schizophrenia, Patients diagnosed with schizophrenia as their first episode (<7 years' duration of illness) and receiving treatment from the Central Institute of Psychiatry, Ranchi will be invited for the study. The patients will be explained about the study and the patients giving the consent for the study will be screened for vitamin D3 insufficiency/deficiency. The patient would be selected for the study if 25 (OH) D is below 30 ng/ml and fulfils the clinical inclusion criteria. The patient would be recalled for enrolment in the study and the socio-demographic details will be collected along with the baseline evaluation. The patients will be randomized to either vitamin D3 or B-Complex group in a 1:1 proportion. Both the groups would be matched for age and gender as these may affect clinical outcome of schizophrenia and will balance the unknown confounding factors. The randomization scheme will utilize computer-generated random numbers that will be available with the PI who will supervise the dispensing the medication, the research assistant will be blind to the randomization numbers. This scheme will be stored in a password-protected computer and password-protected file. Only PI will have access to this file. The file will be opened only if a participant reports serious side effects. The double-blind design will be continued through the study period. The medications will be stored at room temperature and the investigators will supervise the dispensing of the study medication to subjects and/or their caregivers. Patients randomized to vitamin D3 arm will receive 4 tablets (containing 60,000 IU vitamin D3) on the first day of visit and after the fourth week (visit 3) respectively to be taken by mouth on fixed days every week. This dose is the recommended regimen by International Endrocrinological Society. The subjects will receive either vitamin D3 or B Complex weekly for 08 weeks along with the antipsychotic medications as determined by the treating team. The treating team will be encouraged to maintain stable doses if feasible. After the duration of 08 weeks, the dosage of vitamin D3 will be continued as per the serum levels and the recommendation guidelines whereas the antipsychotic medications will be continued as per the clinical response and decision of the treating team., 0

2	Virtual Rehabilitation for the Treatment of Motivational Deficits in Schizophrenia, Motivational deficits have emerged as a critical determinant of functional disability in schizophrenia (SZ). Despite significant advances in our understanding and treatment of the illness, effective therapeutic strategies for motivational deficits have remained elusive. This has ultimately hindered our ability to promote recovery for individuals with SZ so that they can return to their premorbid level of functioning. An emerging therapeutic approach in SZ has utilized computerized remediation strategies, with recent efforts focused on cognitive deficits. To date, however, such a therapeutic strategy has not been developed for the critical motivational deficits in SZ. In light of the detrimental functional consequences of motivational deficits in SZ, there is a clear need for effective therapeutic strategies for the treatment of these motivational deficits experienced by affected individuals. To address this unmet therapeutic need, this pilot therapeutic trial will investigate the efficacy of a novel virtual reality-based motivation rehabilitation program in schizophrenia., Virtual Reality|Negative Symptoms

2	Antidepressant Controlled Trial for Negative Symptoms in Schizophrenia, The negative symptoms of schizophrenia represent an important dimension of psychopathology, and reflect the absence or diminution of normal behaviours and functions. They include deficiencies in emotional responsiveness, drive, and emotional and social engagement. Persistent negative symptoms are held to account for much of the long-term morbidity and poor functional outcome in patients with established schizophrenia, but if they prove resistant to antipsychotic medication there is a very limited evidence base regarding specific treatments. The aim of this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial is to establish the clinical and cost effectiveness of an SSRI antidepressant, citalopram, in the management of negative symptoms of schizophrenia over a year. The study sample will be adults with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, clinically stable for 3 months with a consistent antipsychotic regimen, and characterised by persistent negative symptoms to a criterion level of severity., SSRI antidepressant|Negative symptoms|Schizophrenia
1	Collaborative Study Of Neurofeedback Training Of 6-18 Year Olds With Autism, The specific objective is to demonstrate quantitative and qualitative improvements in functional and behavioral parameters in individuals affected by Autism Spectrum Disorders when 60 Neurofeedback training sessions are applied. The long term objectives for these individuals include improvement of quality of daily functioning, better ability to integrate and navigate within society, and overall to decrease the limitations caused by the disability. Additionally, increasing awareness by the public, as well as healthcare providers and legislation, that Neurofeedback is a viable intervention which may contribute not only to a significant reduction of the level of disability for affected individuals, but also in reducing required lifetime costs of healthcare. Hopefully in the future Neurofeedback training would be incorporated as a standard of care for ASD. As of today, there are around 1000 trained Neurofeedback practitioners in the US who are offering this intervention to a very limited number of individuals due to lack of recognition of NFB benefits., Neurofeedback|Braintraining|Autism|Mild|Moderate|Mild to Moderate Autism

All available sources of information (patient, family, medical records and mental health workers) will be used to complete the form.||The Premorbid Adjustment Scale (PAS) will be used to assess premorbid adjustment. It evaluates the achieved level of functioning before the onset of schizophrenia in four areas (social accessibility/isolation, peer relationships, ability to function outside the nuclear family, and capacity to form intimate social - sexual ties) during 4 periods of subject's life (childhood; early adolescence; late adolescence; adulthood), as well as the highest achieved global level of functioning. It comprises 26 items with a score ranging from 0 (healthiest end of the adjustment range) to 6 (indicating the least healthy end).||General psychopathology and positive symptoms will be evaluated using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).||Negative symptoms will be assessed using the Brief Negative Symptom Scale (BNSS). This scale includes 13 items and assesses 5 domains of negative symptoms: anhedonia, asociality, avolition, blunted affect and alogia, as well as a control item, not included in the negative domains, ""Distress"". For all items of the 5 domains higher scores are associated with greater impairment/presence of symptoms, while for the item Distress the highest score is associated with reduction or absence of negative emotions.||Depressive symptoms will be investigated using the Calgary Depression Rating Scale (CDRS), a rating scale designed to assess the level of depression in people with schizophrenia. It includes 9 items (depression; hopelessness; self depreciation; guilty ideas of reference; pathological guilt; morning depression; early wakening; suicide; observed depression) with a score ranging from 0 (absent) to 3 (severe).||The possible presence of extrapyramidal symptoms, whose assessment is required to exclude that the observed negative symptoms are secondary to them, will be verified by means of the St. Hans Rating Scale (SHRS), a multidimensional rating scale comprising four subscales: hyperkinesias, parkinsonism, akathisia and dystonia. Each subscale includes one or more items with a score ranging from 0 (absent) to 6 (severe).||Neurocognitive functions will be evaluated by means of the Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB). The battery includes tests for the assessment of seven distinct cognitive domains: a) processing speed, b) attention/vigilance, c) working memory, d) verbal learning, e) visual learning, f) social cognition and g) reasoning and problem solving.||The assessment of social cognition, partly included in the MCCB, will be completed using the Facial Emotion Identification Test and a theory of mind test The Awareness of Social Inference Test (TASIT). In the Facial Emotion Identification Test (FEIT), 55 faces are presented on a screen; the subject has to choose the facial emotion expressed by each face among 7 possibilities (anger, disgust, neutral, happiness, surprise, fear, sadness). The TASIT includes three sections: 1) Emotion Evaluation Test, that examines the ability to recognize basic emotions shown by other people, in which 28 vignettes are presented to the subject who has to choose the emotion expressed by a target actor from a multiple-choice array (surprise, happiness, anger, sadness, anxiety, disgust, neutral); 2) Test of Social Inference (Minimal), that evaluates the ability to perceive social inferences, specifically those involving the use of sarcasm; 15 vignettes are presented and the subject has to answer, for each vignette, four questions regarding, respectively, what one of the actors was ""doing"", what was he/she trying to ""say"", what was he/she ""thinking"" and what was he/she ""feeling""; 3) Test of Social Inference (Enriched), that evaluates the ability to perceive social inferences involving lying and using sarcasm; 16 vignettes are presented and the same questions of the second section are asked.||Assessment of personal resources The evaluation of physical health status will be carried out through the application of a standardized protocol developed by the unit N. 5 of Naples.||The assessment of coping style will be made by means of the Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced inventory - Brief, including 28 items, divided into 14 scales: positive reframing, self-distraction, expression, use of instrumental support, active coping, denial, religion, humor, behavioral disengagement, use of emotional support, substance use, acceptance, planning, self-blame. The tool aims to capture a wide range of coping strategies in real life situations.||The evaluation of self-esteem will be carried out using the Self-Esteem Rating Scale (SERS), which assesses different aspects of the self-esteem, such as feeling socially and self-competent, being worth of respect, feeling intelligent and able to solve problems. SERS is composed of 40 items, with ratings on a 7-point Likert scale.||The recovery style will be evaluated using the Recovery Style Questionnaire. This self-administered instrument consists of 39 items that refer to the construct of continuity, ownership, responsibility, curiosity, education, help-seeking, blame, cause, optimism, impact, fear, liking and satisfaction. For each of them the person is categorized as sealer or integrator.||Resilience will be evaluated through the Resilience Scale for Adults (RSA). The RSA is a scale that provides a multidimensional assessment of resilience general characteristics. It includes 33 items that examine intra-and inter-personal protective factors thought to facilitate adaptation when facing psychosocial adversity. Factor analysis showed six factors: a) personal competence, b) positive perception of the future, c) social competence, d), personal structure, and) family cohesion, f) social resources.||The relationship with mental health services will be evaluated with the Service Engagement Scale (SES), which includes 16 items grouped into 4 subscales: a) availability, b) cooperation c) help seeking d) adherence to treatment. The person is given a score on a 4-point Likert scale. c) Evaluation of factors related to the context. For the evaluation of subject's family social - economic status the Social Economic Status will be used. The SES is based on: a) education and b) type of work. The educational level is measured on a 7-level scale (1=elementary school, 7=post-degree/specialization courses) and the type of work is rated on a 9-level scale (1=laborer, 9=high level managerial positions). To calculate the index the education level and the type of work of each parent is weighted.||The amount of social policies expenditure and the unemployment rate in the geographical macro-area (Northeast, Northwest, Central, South and Islands) will be taken from the latest Italian National Institute of Statistic (ISTAT) tables. The availability of a disability pension, and access to family and social incentives will be investigated through a social - demographic questionnaire developed ad hoc with which data on sex, age, marital status, schooling, housing, and luxuries habits will be also collected. For the evaluation of the social network the Social Network Questionnaire (SNQ) will be used. It is a self-administered questionnaire that evaluates the structural and qualitative aspects of the social network. It includes 15 items, grouped into 4 factors: a) quality and frequency of social contacts; b) practical social support; c) emotional support, d) quality of an intimate relationship. Each item is rated on a scale from 1 ""never"" to 4 ""always"". The evaluation of the stigma associated with mental illness will be carried out using two instruments: the Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness (ISMI), which will be administered to all patients and evaluates the experience of stigma and internalized self-rejection, and the Perceived Devaluation and Discrimination Scale (PDD), which measures the perceived stigma, i.e., the attitudes of the general population with respect to mental disorders, which will be administered to all subjects. The ISMI is a scale that includes 29 items and 5 subscales for self-assessment of subjective experience of stigma. Each item is rated on a 4-level Likert scale, where higher scores indicate greater levels of internalized stigma. The PDD includes 12 items, each of whom is rated on a 5-level Likert scale, with higher scores indicating greater stigma.||d) Assessment of functional capacity and real-life functioning The functional capacity will be evaluated using the short version of the Performance-based Skills Assessment, University of California, San Diego (UCSD) , a performance-based instrument that investigates two areas: Financial Skills (counting money, counting change and paying bills) and Communication Skills (to dial a telephone number for emergency, for information, dial a telephone number from memory; to reschedule an appointment by telephone; to understand and to remember the instructions on a Medical Doctor Appointment Letter). Individual real-life functioning will be assessed by the Specific Level of Function Scale (SLOF), a hybrid instrument that explores many aspects of functioning and is based on judgments by a caregiver/operator (or the direct observation) of behavior and functioning of patients. It consists of 43 items and includes the following domains: a) physical efficiency; b) skills in self-care; c) interpersonal relationships; d) social acceptability; e) community activities (e.g., shopping, using public transportation); f) working abilities. The scale that assesses ""Personal and Social Functioning"" (PSF) will be also used; it evaluates the areas of self-care, socially useful activities, personal and social relationships and disturbing and aggressive behaviors.||GENETIC ASSOCIATION ANALYSES WITH THE PHENOTYPES OF INTEREST The Naples research unit n. 6 will perform an association study between selected putative schizophrenia genes and specific psychometric, neurophysiological and neurocognitive schizophrenia endophenotypes; moreover, the research unit will search for de novo copy-number variations (CNV) as putative risk factors for schizophrenia or schizophrenia endophenotypes and for de novo protein-altering mutations that may contribute to the genetic component of schizophrenia endophenotypes.||STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF DATA To identify the factors that affect most real-life functioning of people diagnosed with schizophrenia multiple regression statistical models will be used. Real-life functioning and functional capacity indices will be defined as dependent variables. The three blocks of variables, i.e. disease-related variable, personal resources and context-related variables, will be the independent variables or predictors. structural equation model (SEM), that according to some authors is robust against the problem of multicollinearity occurring in a regression model when there is a linear correlation among the independent variables, will be used. This analysis allows to draw assumptions on the causality between the variables and, based on path analysis o identify potential factors mediating and moderating the relationships between dependent and independent variables. The explored models will be subsequently tested with confirmatory analyses.||Estimated sample size for this analysis is of at least 5 independent observations for each index in the model. Therefore, by including in the model: 3 demographic indices (age, sex and education), 15 variables related to the disease (PANSS-general and PANSS-positive subscale scores, 2 negative symptom domains derived from BNSS, 6 cognitive domains from the MCCB, 4 indices of social cognition, derived from the specific section of the MCCB, TASIT and FEIT, the total score for depression on the Calgary scale), 36 indices related to the personal resources (6 factors of Resilience, 14 Coping factors, 13 Recovery styles factors, 1 score for Self-Esteem, 1 index of relationship with mental health services, 1 physical health index) and 10 related to the context (1 index of economic status, 5 indices of financial opportunities and work/family and social incentives, 2 stigma indices, 2 social network factors), for a total of 64 indices, it is estimated that an appropriate sample of patients will be 64x5=320 subjects.||The effects of dichotomous variables (eg, gender) and ordinal (eg, social class) will be assessed with one- or multiple-way analyses of variance. The analyses will be conducted using the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS)., Schizophrenia|Real-Life Functioning|Schizophrenia Endophenotypes"

2	"Risperidone Augmentation in Patients With Schizophrenia, Specific Aims - We propose a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to study the effectiveness and tolerability of adding risperidone to stable yet only partially remitted patients with schizophrenia maintained on clozapine. We anticipate enrolling a total of 40 subjects over a period of two years at the Freedom Trail Clinic and affiliated sites in Boston, Massachusetts. Our primary outcome measure will be change in total score on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Secondary hypotheses are (1) that the clozapine-risperidone combination is well tolerated, (2) that clozapine levels will not be influenced by risperidone, and (3) that prolactin elevation is suitable as a surrogate marker of sufficient D2 blockade to predict response.||Background - Despite a new generation of antipsychotics, many patients with schizophrenia achieve only partial syndromal remission. In an effort to improve symptomatic and functional outcomes, it has become common practice to combine antipsychotic medications. Since this strategy is largely unproven and expensive, empirical trials are urgently needed. Our group has found in an open trial that adding risperidone to clozapine was well tolerated and led to improvement in psychopathology. Additional support for increasing D2 blockade in clozapine partial responders comes form two small studies using sulpiride and pimozide. We hypothesize that there is a subgroup of patients who might benefit from additional D2 blockade beyond what clozapine alone accomplishes.||Methods - The proposed trial will be placebo-controlled, randomized, and double-blind, and it will last 8 weeks. We expect to enroll 40 subjects overall. Subjects will be eligible if they are diagnosed with schizophrenia and treated with clozapine. In addition, they must have residual symptoms of schizophrenia as we are interested in improvement of residual psychopathology. Subjects with dementia or mental retardation as well as pregnant women will be excluded. After a 2-week placebo lead-in period to assure stable psychopathology and minimize placebo-response, subjects will be randomly allocated to receive 6 weeks of either risperidone (20 subjects), or matching placebo (20 subjects) added onto their customary antipsychotic medication, clozapine. Overall, there are 5 study visits every 2 weeks plus the initial screening visit. On each visit, subjects will be evaluated with standard psychiatric rating scales of psychopathology and side effects. In addition, we will measure serum levels of the medications used, clozapine and risperidone.||Fasting glucose will be measured at screening, week 4, and week 8 visits. This is done to monitor subjects for worsening glucose control. This is a possible concern due to the association between atypical antipsychotics, including risperidone, and hyperglycemia. Subjects who are discovered to either have diabetes or develop diabetes during the study, or who have worsening glucose control if diabetic, will be discontinued and referred to their PCP for further work-up and treatment. This additional blood test will not lead to additional blood draws but will simply be added to the subject's routine and mandated biweekly WBC monitoring.||The study endpoint will be a 20% improvement on our primary rating scale of psychopathology, the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). No worsening of psychopathology is expected in this trial as subjects are maintained on primary antipsychotic, clozapine.||Benefits - There are no definite benefits to participating in this trial. Subjects will receive a thorough psychiatric evaluation, a review of their pharmacologic treatment, and a physical exam with some baseline laboratory studies. The results of the initial evaluation will be communicated to the treating psychiatrist. Subjects will receive a nominal fee of $20 per study visit (5 study visits are scheduled overall).||The proposed study has direct clinical applications, and it is of theoretical interest. Few data are available from controlled trials to guide clinicians when patients remain symptomatic on clozapine. From a conceptual standpoint, the study will clarify the value of additional D2 blockade for treatment response.||Risks and Discomforts - Risperidone is approved by the FDA for the treatment of schizophrenia. The dose of 4 mg is on the lower end of the dosing recommendations and is usually well tolerated. Possible side effects are sedation, extrapyramidal symptoms, akathisia, hyperprolactinemia, or orthostatic hypotension. Tardive dyskinesia is a long-term side effect and would not be expected in a 6-week trial. However, existing tardive dyskinesia could worsen.||Blood drawing entails transient discomfort, and it might lead to a hematoma at the site. Being interviewed for clinical symptoms with the help of rating scales can be tiring and upsetting if sensitive psychological experiences are discussed. There is also an association between atypical antipsychotics, including risperidone, and hyperglycemia, requiring some monitoring of blood sugars during treatment. No inpatient hospital time is required.||Minimization of Risks - To minimized discomfort from blood draws, the study blood work will be added onto the mandatory blood draws that subjects undergo because they receive clozapine. Vital signs will be monitored at baseline and every two weeks. Side effects will be monitored at baseline and every two weeks. The Systematic Assessment for Treatment Emergent Events (SAFTEE) will be the primary instrument used to detect side effects. The SAFTEE will be used to tabulate side effects for the yearly IRB summary. Serious adverse events, as well as adverse events, will be reviewed by the PI and reported to the IRB according to institutional policy. The PIs in our group meet weekly to review study protocols and study events.||Fasting glucose will be measured at screening, week 4, and week 8 visits. This is done to monitor subjects for worsening glucose control. This is a possible concern due to the association between atypical antipsychotics, including risperidone, and hyperglycemia. Subjects who are discovered to either have diabetes or develop diabetes during the study or who have worsening glucose control (poor glucose control as judged by new-onset diabetes or new-onset glucose intolerance.) will be discontinued and referred to their primary care physician (PCP) for further work-up and treatment. In patients with established diabetes, the six weeks of active treatment will not be long enough to meaningfully judge if diabetes control is more difficult than usual (typical parameters of glucose control such as hemoglobin A1C are a reflection of long-term glucose control, i.e. several months). We will follow those patients clinically in cooperation with the PCP to decide if patients can stay in the trial. This additional blood test will not lead to additional blood draws but will simply be added to the subject's routine and mandated biweekly white blood cell count monitoring.||Patients will be withdrawn from the study if they become suicidal or deteriorate psychiatrically. This will be assessed every 2 weeks using the PANSS and Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS): clinical deterioration will be defined as a 20% increase in total PANSS scores, and suicidality will be defined as a rating of ""mild"" (frequent thoughts of being better off dead, or occasional thought of suicide) on the CDSS. Subjects who have worsening symptoms of tardive dyskinesia (TD) will be discontinued and referred to their psychiatrist for further work-up and treatment (Worsening TD as judged by 20% increase in Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS))., Schizophrenia|risperidone|prolactin|clozapine"
2	Linear and Non-linear Analysis of EEG Changes in Schizophrenia After Atypical Antipsychotics Medication, Electroencephalographic (EEG) changes are abundant in patients receiving antipsychotic treatment. However, studies on the meaning of these changes are rare. The results of traditional analyses based on linear methodologies were inconsistent and hard to interpret. Therefore, non-linear analyses of EEG may provide additional information in evaluating antipsychotic-induced changes in EEG.||In this study, we hypothesized that linear and non-linear EEG changes in patients with schizophrenia may be valuable in predicting treatment outcome. We also hypothesized that the assessment of other psychotic symptoms and side effects of antipsychotics may provide additional information in interpreting the results of EEG analyses., schizophrenia|atypical antipsychotics|EEG

1	"The Effectiveness of an Autistic-delivered Peer-support Intervention for Autistic Adults: Community Autism Peer Specialist (CAPS) Program, Approximately 5.4 million adults in the United States (1 in 45) are believed to have autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but there is a lack of services available to support them in reaching their full potential. Although typically conceptualized as a childhood disorder, ASD-related service needs persist into adulthood. The core social and communication impairments of ASD, reported difficulties with change, and a high rate of co-occurring mental health conditions often result in limited participation in major life areas that are determinants of health, including social and community participation, employment, housing, and transportation. The transition to adulthood is not only associated with developmental challenges, but also a ""services cliff"" whereby supports and services that were previously available through the education system are no longer available. Peer-delivered interventions have emerged as a potent, evidence-based modality for enhancing outcomes among other clinical populations, such as adults with serious mental illnesses, with effectiveness in enhancing social networks, empowering participants, reducing the use of inpatient services, and increasing life satisfaction. At present, there is limited research on the effectiveness of autistic-led peer support interventions, especially those that target broad aspects of community functioning. The proposed study seeks to refine, manualize, and test a pilot autistic peer support program aimed at supporting community participation among autistic young adults, with the goal of preparing it for large-scale testing and future dissemination and sustainability. The first aim of this proposal is to enhance the structure of a pilot autistic-peer delivered intervention (Community Autism Peer Specialists, or CAPS) that is currently in use as a Medicaid-reimbursed service in Philadelphia. This will include developing a manual and fidelity tool to facilitate evaluation and systematic implementation. The second and third aims are to conduct a hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation randomized controlled trial with 40 young autistic adults to test the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and research procedures, while also examining proposed target mechanisms of action (e.g., self-efficacy, working alliance, perceived social support) and clinical outcomes such as community participation, loneliness, and resilience. This work will gather additional evidence and implementation information to support a fully-powered R01- funded clinical trial. The proposed efforts will involve substantial engagement of a diverse group of autistic adults in all phases along with multiple community partners, including a Medicaid payer. The project has tremendous potential to expand service options for autistic adults and is uniquely poised to have broad, scalable impact., peer support|adult|developmental disabilities|independent living|participation"

2	Cognitive Remediation for Schizophrenia, Schizophrenia is associated with neurocognitive impairment, diminished life satisfaction, lack of independence, and poor functioning in social, occupational and other desired and expected community roles. The personal, social and economic costs of this illness are enormous. Neurocognitive deficits (e.g., slowed thinking, poor attention and memory, inadequate problem solving) are now recognized as core features of the illness, and primary contributors to functional impairment among patients (Bellack, Gold & Buchanan; 1999; Green, 1996). While standard antipsychotic medications improve psychotic symptomatology in many patients, their impact on neurocognition is modest, at best, and dramatic functional deficits remain even after adequate pharmacological treatment (Keefe et al., 1999). Hence, there is growing interest in alternative treatment strategies to address cognitive deficits, including computer-assisted cognitive remediation.||The purpose of this project is to assess the efficacy of a computer-assisted cognitive remediation program we have developed: Computer Assisted Cognitive Remediation (CACR). Fifty individuals with schizophrenia and related disorders will be recruited and randomly assigned to one of two conditions: a) 36 sessions of CACR; or b) 36 sessions of a manualized computer control condition (RC). The efficacy of CACR will be assessed on behavioral performance in three dimensions: (1) on the trained learning exercises, (2) on neuropsychological measures, and (3) on role play based assessments of everyday problem solving. We hypothesize that CACR will be more effective than the control treatment in each domain., treatment|cognition|schizophrenia

0	Do Mind Ease Interventions Reduce Feelings of Acute Anxiety? A Randomised Controlled Trial, Anxiety is a common symptom in the world's population (Whiteford et al., 2013). It occurs as a symptom within other mental disorders and as a disorder in itself (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).||There are several ways of dealing with anxiety, from short guidance for coping on a symptom level to professional health. (Emmelkamp &amp; Ehring, 2014). Many people suffering from anxiety below a threshold indicating need for professional therapy may profit from strategies to calm down. (Helmchen &amp; Linden, 2000). Among the strategies that are effective, there are guided interventions that people can use via a web-based interface on a computer or smartphone (Taylor et al., 2021). While it is known for most interventions that they are helpful, it is often unclear if they work also in web-based environments (Baumel et al., 2020). This is because most research regarding the topic investigates the effectiveness of mental-health apps as a whole, while research of specific interventions is missing (Domhardt et al., 2019). However, to develop effective apps, it is crucial to identify which specific interventions are most efficient in a web-based setting. (Domhardt et al., 2019; Firth et al., 2017). Therefore we want to identify interventions working effectively in an online format.||Mind Ease is an app that offers different established interventions within one framework to their users when they feel anxious. This framework makes the different interventions comparable to each other. For this reason, we will test the interventions that are used in the Mind Ease-app.||In a first study we will correlate the Mind Ease 3-sliders-score with the state-trait- anxiety-Inventory (SAI). In a second study we will measure participants'; acute anxiety (with the 3-sliders- score) before and after they performed a 10 minutes web-based cognitive or mindfulness-associated intervention. We will compare the anticipated reduction in anxiety to the reduction measured in participants in a control group.||Prospectively registered here: https://osf.io/36ukh, anxiety|app|psychotherapy|mindfulness|acceptance and commitment therapy|cognitive behavioural therapy|randomised controlled trial|depression
2	15 Month Study for Adults Who Have Been Diagnosed With Schizophrenia and Incarcerated, The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of paliperidone palmitate with oral antipsychotic treatment in delaying time to a protocol-defined treatment failure over 15 months, in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia who have been incarcerated. Protocol-defined treatment failure is defined as arrest, psychiatric hospitalization, increase in psychiatric services to prevent imminent hospitalization, discontinuation of antipsychotic treatment due to inadequate efficacy, treatment supplementation with another antipsychotic due to inadequate efficacy, discontinuation of antipsychotic treatment due to safety or tolerability or completed suicide. Protocol was amended on March 15, 2011 to reflect changes in the inclusion/exclusion criteria as well as the study objectives.

2	"Multicenter, Open-Label, Randomised, Haloperidol-controlled Study to Evaluate Seroquel as Mono-Therapy in the Treatment of Agitated Symptoms in the Patients With Acute Episode of Schizophrenia, Both medication and patient can affect the compliance of patients to treatment. The control of schizophrenia syndromes effectively and rapidly will build up the confidence of patients on treatments. These early effects may influence the long-term compliance and prognosis of patients. And the antipsychotic medications with neuroprotection effect can significantly improve the long-term prognosis of patients, too.In the past, we always think that there is ""delayed onset of antipsychotic"" by antipsychotic medications. Recently, a large sample study indicated that the onset of antipsychotic effect was as early as the first day after administration (in 24 hours). This study was carried out in order to compare the second-generation antipsychotic agent- quetiapine with the first-generation antipsychotic agent- haloperidol on the onset time of treatment., PANSS|Acute Episode of Schizophrenia"
2	"Effects of Acute Nicotine Treatment on Neuroplasticity and Memory in Patients With Schizophrenia, Background: Schizophrenia (SCZ) is frequently associated with marked working memory (WM) deficits whose pathophysiology is closely related to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)-dependent dysfunction[1]. These deficits predict disease outcome and poor response to antipsychotic treatment[2]. Consequently, elucidating the physiology of DLPFC-dependent WM deficits in SCZ is key in better understanding this illness and its treatment.||Patients with SCZ display an unusually high prevalence of smoking and high rates of smoking cessation failures are commonly associated with WM deficits[3]. The central nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) is the main target for nicotine. Several lines of evidence strongly suggest that the nAChR system is a promising target for treating cognitive deficits in SCZ. These include the following observations: (1) expression of nAChRs receptors is abnormal in several brain regions, including the PFC, in post mortem brains of patients with SCZ, (2) genes coding for nAChR subunits are candidate risk genes for SCZ and nicotine addiction, and (3) smoking abstinence produce deficits of WM, which correlate with blood levels of nicotine, are alleviated by smoking re-instatement and are blocked by nAChR antagonists in patients with SCZ, but not in healthy control smokers (e.g.,[4]). However, the underlying mechanism through which nicotine and nAChRs affect DLPFC-dependent memory in SCZ are still unknown. Nicotine-induced increases in neural plasticity may represent one such mechanism.||Neuroplasticity, which includes long-term potentiation (LTP), is a proposed physiological mechanism for memory formation. LTP is dependent on an optimal interaction between the glutamate (GLU), dopamine (DA) and γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) systems and perturbations in these systems likely explain why patients with SCZ demonstrate deficits in WM and neuroplasticity[5,6]. nAChR are present on GABA, GLU and DA neurons and nicotine could potentially improve cognition by modulating these systems. Studies have demonstrated that acute nicotine administration potentiates neural plasticity in the motor cortex of healthy human subjects. One of these studies used Paired Associative Stimulation (PAS), a powerful paradigm to index LTP in the motor cortex, to assess the effects of nicotine on LTP in non-smokers[7]. The results demonstrate that nicotine enhanced LTP-like mechanisms induced by PAS in the motor cortex[7]. To date, however, there has been no direct measure of LTP-like plasticity from the DLPFC in humans. To overcome this challenge, the investigators group has developed a novel PAS technique of combined transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG)[8] to directly index LTP from the DLPFC.||Conventional methods of applying PAS involves the repetitive delivery of two paired stimulations: the first being an electrical peripheral nerve stimulation of the right median nerve of the hand and 25 ms later a second TMS pulse delivered to the contralateral motor cortex (hence PAS-25). Through repetitive pairing of these two stimulations, PAS-25 results in increased activation of output neurons that represents a direct measure LTP in humans[9]. The investigators lab has recently recorded PAS-LTP in the DLFPC using a novel technique of TMS-EEG[8]. Here, PAS is applied to the DLPFC by repetitive delivery of: (1) a peripheral nerve stimulation to the right side, followed 25 ms later by; (2) a TMS pulse delivered to the left DLPFC. PAS-induced potentiation of cortical evoked activity is then measured directly from the DLPFC and represents LTP in this region as interneurons activated from cortical stimulation and peripheral stimulation, in turn, activate DLPFC output neurons contemporaneously and increase their activity when repeated over 30 min. Thus, the activation of the somatosensory cortex by peripheral nerve stimulation will propagate to the DLPFC and arrive there simultaneously with the TMS pulse resulting in LTP. The validity of this technique relies on the observation that there are strong correlations between TMS induced evoked potentials in the motor and DLPFC (r=0.8-0.85, p<0.001)[8]. LTP is quantified as change in DLPFC cortical evoked activity from baseline (pre-PAS) to different time points following PAS-25 (post-PAS). Preliminary data from the investigators ongoing study using these novel methods, demonstrate that PAS-25 induces significant LTP in the DLPFC. For example, in healthy controls cortical evoked activity in the DLPFC was facilitated by 56% post-PAS (maximal point of facilitation) while in patients with SCZ the cortical evoked activity post-PAS was only increased by 16% (Cohen's d=0.80). This is to the investigators knowledge the first time LTP has ever been demonstrated in-vivo in the DLPFC of humans and the first time that LTP deficits in the DLPFC have been reported in patients with SCZ. The aim of this proposal is now to assess whether enhanced WM by nicotine is mediated by potentiation of LTP in the DLPFC.||Hypothesis:||Patients with SCZ will have reduced DLPFC LTP and impaired WM compared to healthy controls.|Acute nicotine gum challenge will attenuate the DLPFC LTP and WM deficit in patients with SCZ.|Plasma nicotine levels will correlate with improvement in DLPFC LTP.|Reversal of the DLPFC LTP deficit in patients with SCZ will be associated with improvement in WM.||Methods:||Subjects: Fourteen healthy non-smokers and 14 non-smokers with SCZ will complete this exploratory study. This sample size is based on a previous study that used the TMS-EEG method and demonstrated a significant difference in cortical inhibition between healthy controls and SCZ patients[10], and will be sufficient to detect a medium effect size (Cohen´s d=0.72; α=0.05, 1-β=0.80) of nicotine treatment. Only patients that are treated with a stable dose of antipsychotic medication (≥1 month) will be enrolled in this study. This could potentially confound the results as the investigators are using healthy non-medicated controls for comparison. However, the within- subjects design is an effort to control for such effects. Study design: The study will be a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover study consisting of two PAS-25 testing sessions one month apart, followed by a 7 day post-PAS follow-up test session each. Pharmacological treatment: Nicotine (4 mg) or matching placebo gum will be administered on each of the two test days before baseline TMS-EEG recording. Maximum nicotine blood concentration is reached after 30 min, at which point blood samples will be drawn to assess nicotine levels. WM assessment: The N-back task measures the ability to maintain active information online (i.e. WM) and is dependent on DLPFC functioning. Letters are presented in a continuous sequence and the subject is asked to respond if they recognize the present letter as the same letter appears that appeared as the N (0, 1, 2 or 3) letters back, i.e. ""N-back"". The N-back will be administered at the pre-test training session (to control for training effects), baseline, 120 minutes and 1 week post PAS. Paired Associative Stimulation (PAS): The pairings will occur over a 30 min period and the peripheral nerve stimulation and TMS to the DLPFC will be delivered at 0.1 Hz. To assure the DLPFC localization, neuronavigational techniques using the MRIcro/reg software and a T1-weight MRI scan will be used. Quantifying LTP: To assess DLPFC LTP, change in cortical evoked activity will be measured using pre- and post-PAS TMS-EEG recordings. TMS pulses will be generated using two Magstim 200 stimulators (Magstim Company Ltd., UK) connected to and a 7 cm figure-of-eight coil via a Bistim module. A train of 100 pulses (0.1 Hz) will be administered together with EEG recordings; (1) before PAS in order to assess baseline cortical evoked activity and (2) at different time points (0, 15, 30, 60,120 min and 7 days) following PAS-25. EEG will be recorded using the DLPFC-corresponding electrodes of a 64-channel Synamps 2 EEG system. Cortical evoked activity will be defined as the area under the rectified curve for the averaged EEG recordings (50-275 ms post-stimulus) and LTP will be quantified as the change in cortical evoked activity from baseline. Statistics: Within and between subjects comparisons will be carried out using repeated measures, mixed-factorial, ANOVAs when appropriate. Relationship between LTP and nicotine levels will be assessed using Pearson correlations. P-values will be set to 0.05 and multiple comparisons will be Bonferroni corrected.||Significance: The results of this study will provide important new knowledge about mechanisms underlying cognitive enhancement strategies in SCZ. That is, the investigators intend to decipher the complex pharmacological mechanisms that underlie nicotinic cholinergic enhancement of plasticity in the DLPFC. Such findings will also help to generate important biomarkers through which cognitive enhancing strategies may be measured biologically that can potentially lead to the development of more personalized treatments of cognitive deficits in this debilitating disorder., nicotine|memory|plasticity|TMS|Paired Associative Stimulation"
2	Neurophysiological Targets for Cognitive Training in Schizophrenia, Schizophrenia is recognized as one of the leading causes of medical disability worldwide, ranked 9th overall by the World Health Organization, and affects more than 2 million Americans per year. There is considerable evidence to suggest that disability status in schizophrenia relates more directly to cognitive Impairment, involving attention, reasoning, and memory, than to characteristic symptoms of psychosis. Accordingly, the evaluation and advancement of interventions designed to restore cognitive function, generally termed cognitive remediation, is of critical importance to our rehabilitation mission. Recent randomized controlled trials of cognitive remediation in schizophrenia have found moderate gains in cognitive function and improved outcomes in important areas of community living. However, despite these encouraging findings, there remains sparse evidence in support of assumptions that (1) cognitive outcomes represent benefits of training-induced adaptive learning, (2) that training effects are specific to method of intervention, or (3) that change in cognitive test performance occurs through restoration of impaired neural circuitry in schizophrenia. This project will begin to address these issues by examining modality-specific effects of computer-based cognitive training on psychophysiological measures of sensory information processing. Training will be administered using two commercially available computer-based software packages, separately targeting auditory and visually-mediated processes using principles of bottom-up perceptual learning. Two psychophysiological paradigms, mismatch negativity (MMN) and P300 generation, will be administered as tests of early visual and auditory processing. MMN and P300 have been studied extensively in human neuroscience as probes of sensory echoic memory and attention engagement to contextually relevant information. Furthermore, reductions in MMN and P300 generation are reliably observed in schizophrenia, follow the course of a progressive neuropathological process, and correlate with severity of cognitive impairment. The specific aims of this study are to determine: (1) whether training selectively influences bottom-up (MMN) or top-down (P300) information processing, (2) whether training effects are modality (auditory vs. visual) specific, (3) whether baseline MMN and P300 predict, or rate-limit, training progress, and (4) whether pre-post change in cognitive test performance is mediated by neural-level change in MMN and P300 generation. Answers to these questions will provide information needed to structure cognitive training for maximum benefit in schizophrenia., schizophrenia|cognitive remediation|rehabilitation|electrophysiology|neuropsychology

2	A 6 Month Study to Compare the Metabolic Effects of Paliperidone ER and Olanzapine in Patients With Schizophrenia, This is a prospective randomized (study medication is assigned by change) open-label, parallel-group, multicenter, 6 month study to compare the metabolic effects of paliperidone ER and olanzapine in patients with schizophrenia using the ratio of the concentration of lipids (triglycerides) in the blood to the concentration of good cholesterol (high density lipoproteins (HDL)) as the primary parameter. Secondary objectives include evaluation of additional parameters related to the total of the actions of the body to keep it alive (metabolic endpoints) and demonstration of non-inferiority of paliperidone ER versus olanzapine in efficacy as measured by Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Patients previously treated with any oral antipsychotic, except those treated with paliperidone ER, olanzapine or clozapine during the last 6 months, can be enrolled and will be treated with paliperidone ER (6 to 9 mg/day) or olanzapine (10 to 15 mg/day). Patients will be divided into groups according to the metabolic effects of their previous antipsychotic medication (medication that does not increase body weight vs. medication that increases body weight). Throughout the study flexible dosing is allowed based on the investigator discretion. A study treatment period of 6 months is planned for all patients. Medication to treat symptoms like confusion, blurred vision, constipation, dry mouth, light-headedness, difficulty starting and continuing to urinate, and loss of bladder control may continue up to four weeks and should then be tapered off at the discretion of the investigator. Approximately 456 adult patients (228 in each treatment group) will participate in this study. Efficacy will be assessed with the following measures: PANSS (total score and subscale scores), Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S), Self-rated health status Survey SF-36, and Sleep and daytime drowsiness evaluation scale. The parameters related to the total of the actions of the body to keep it alive (metabolic endpoints) will be assessed with the following: ratio of blood lipids to blood good cholesterol concentrations (TG:HDL ratio) (for this primary evaluation, plasma fasting lipids and good cholesterol concentrations will be measured), fasting plasma insulin and fasting plasma glucose, plasma glucose and insulin concentrations before and after a 75 gram oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to asses insulin sensitivity and changes in insulin secretion, fasting good cholesterol, lipids, and glucose levels for the determination of new onset or presence of metabolic syndrome during treatment according to criteria of the Third Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (NCEP/ATPIII criteria), weight, Body-Mass-Index and waist circumference for the determination of new onset or presence of a medical condition associated with abdominal obesity, abnormalities in glucose, lipid and cholesterol metabolism, and elevated blood pressure that increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes (metabolic syndrome) during treatment according to NCEP/ATP III criteria. All patients who receive trial medication (paliperidone ER or olanzapine) at least once will be included in the analysis of the demographic and baseline characteristic data. 2 dosage levels of paliperidone ER (6 or 9mg per day) and 2 of olanzapine (10 and 15mg per day) are available to the patients.

2	Monotherapy of an NMDA Enhancer for Schizophrenia, Several lines of evidence suggest that schizophrenia is associated with accelerated aging and oxidative stress may play a role. Cognitive deficits are core symptoms of accelerated aging in patients with schizophrenia and the most difficult domain to treat. Current antipsychotics have limited, if any, efficacy for cognitive function. Previous studies found that some NMDA-enhancing agent was able to augment antioxidant activity and its adjunctive therapy was better than placebo in reducing not only clinical symptoms but also cognitive deficits and revealed favorable safety in patients with chronic schizophrenia. Of note, a substantial portion of schizophrenia patients refuse or cannot tolerate antipsychotics due to poor response or severe side effects. This study aims to examine the efficacy and safety of NMDAE monotherapy for the treatment of schizophrenia. The investigators enroll patients with schizophrenia who refuse or are unable to tolerate antipsychotics due to poor response or adverse effects into a 6-week randomized, double-blind trial to receive monotherapy of NMDAE or placebo. The investigators biweekly measure clinical performances and side effects. Cognitive functions are assessed at baseline and at endpoint of treatment by a battery of tests. The efficacies of NMDAE and placebo will be compared.||Chi-square (or Fisher's exact test) will be used to compare differences of categorical variables and t-test (or Mann-Whitney test if the distribution is not normal) for continuous variables between treatment groups. Mean changes from baseline in repeated-measure assessments will be assessed using the generalized estimating equation (GEE).

2	DAAOI-1 Treatment for Treatment-resistant Schizophrenia, Pharmacotherapy for schizophrenia has limitations such as residual positive and negative symptoms, cognitive deficits and intolerable side effects. Refractory schizophrenia (particularly clozapine-resistant) is still a difficult clinical issue at present. Among schizophrenia patients, around 20-25%are treatment-resistant. According to the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) hypothesis, many clinical trials on NMDA-enhancing agents were studied. Adjuvant NMDA-enhancing agents, including glycine, D-amino acids (D-serine, D-alanine), and sarcosine (a glycine transporter I inhibitor), revealed beneficial but limited efficacy for positive and negative symptoms. The investigators recently started to study the potential of DAAOI-1, a D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO) inhibitor which can elevate synaptic concentration of D-amino acids.||The aims of this project is to examine the effectiveness and safety of DAAOI-1 adjuvant treatment for clozapine-resistant refractory schizophrenia patients in a randomized, double-blind, placebo - controlled trial., Schizophrenia|NMDA|DAAOI|Clozapine resistant schizophrenia
2	Fingolimod in Schizophrenia Patients, Study Design:||This will be a single site safety and proof of concept study conducted at the Indiana University Psychotic Disorders Program. Forty subjects with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorders will be randomized 1:1 to double-blind treatment with fingolimod or matched placebo for duration of 8 weeks.||All subjects will be admitted to the Indiana Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute Clinical Research Center (CRC) and remain hospitalized for the first 24 (+/- 2) hours post initial dose of study medication. The CRC is located in Indiana University Hospital and has 24 hour staffing with nurses skilled in conducting Phase 1 and Phase 2 investigational drug studies.||Background and Rationale:||Schizophrenia is a severe brain disorder that begins during the teenage years and early twenties and typically progresses to a life-long chronic illness marked by psychotic symptoms, cognitive impairment and poor functioning. A leading hypothesis to account for the symptoms and cognitive dysfunction of this disorder is that abnormalities exist in cortical circuits, particularly in frontal and temporal areas. An interest in cortical circuitry has led to a focus on the integrity of cortical white matter tracts as possibly contributing to the pathophysiology of this illness. Indeed, several lines of evidence have supported abnormalities in white matter structure and function in schizophrenia. Numerous myelin-related genes and their functional expression have been associated with schizophrenia. Moreover, quantitative and qualitative abnormalities in prefrontal cortical oligodendrocytes have been found in postmortem studies. MRI-determined volumetric reductions in prefrontal white matter have been reported in schizophrenia. Advances in MRI technology have enhanced the ability to study white matter pathology in vivo. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and fractional anisotropy (FA) provides an assessment of the density and integrity of white matter tracts. Decreased FA has been reported in many de-myelinating diseases including multiple sclerosis (MS), leukodystrophies, and HIV. Numerous studies using DTI have reported decrements in FA in schizophrenia with the most consistent abnormalities occurring in frontal cortical white matter. Also, FA has been shown to be sensitive to therapeutic drug effects in MS which supports DTI-derived FA as an outcome measure in clinical trials of neuroprotective agents.||Fingolimod (FTY720, approved as Gilenya™ ) is a sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator and recently licensed in the USA and several other countries for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). It is administered as a once per day oral preparation. In registration clinical trials, it had positive effects on brain atrophy, MRI-determined axonal lesions and relapse rates. Significant improvement in the mean number of MRI assessed T1 gadolinium (Gd) enhanced lesions/patient and the percentage of patients free of T1 Gd-enhanced lesions was observed within 6 months of treatment and there was evidence of clinical improvement as early as 2 months after treatment initiation, psychosis|schizophrenia|cognition|fingolimod

The positive symptoms reflect an excess or distortion of normal functions (delusions, hallucinations and disorganized behavior), whereas the negative symptoms are related to flattened affect, alogia, avolition and decreased cognitive function. One recent study reported that schizophrenia is associated with distortions of reality, changes in perceptions and thoughts, difficulties in social situations and problems with daily functions.||Schizophrenia generally appears at the end of adolescence or at the beginning of adulthood and affects approximately 1% of the population. The disease has a deteriorating course and does not involve large neurological changes. Its etiology may be explained by interactions between factors associated with genetic susceptibility and adverse environmental factors. Recently, it has been hypothesized that alterations in neuroplasticity may be an important factor for the development of schizophrenia.||IGF-1 is an important growth factor that induces neuroplasticity (neuronal survival, cell differentiation, cell proliferation, synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis). Schizophrenic patients have lower serum IGF-1 levels than healthy individuals. Because IGF-1 levels are lower in schizophrenic patients and this is associated with the etiology of the disease, it is important to investigate treatments that may increase serum IGF-1. Antipsychotic drugs such as olanzapine stimulate the phosphorylation of AKT, which is part of the main downstream pathway of IGF-1. It is possible to activate AKT through several intracellular signals and receptors, including activation of the insulin receptor (IR). However, activation of the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) appears to be the main activator of AKT phosphorylation.||In addition to antipsychotic medications, resistance exercises may be another way to increase IGF-1 concentrations. This type of physical exercise has been growing in popularity in society. In recent years, evidence has shown benefits from this exercise for different age groups in both healthy and sick individuals, and it has been indicated to augment bone mineral mass, strength and muscular mass; to prevent or treat sarcopenia; to decrease frailty and functional impairment; and to improve cognitive function and hypertension, among other benefits.||Studies conducted with the young and the elderly who underwent resistance training have shown increased serum IGF-1 levels. However, studies showing the effects of resistance training and concurrent training on schizophrenia and serum IGF-1 levels have not been performed. Studying physical exercise is important for several reasons. Importantly, it is a low-cost treatment that may be a possible therapeutic tool, not only to increase IGF-1 concentrations but also to decrease disease symptoms, especially negative symptoms, and the side effects of antipsychotic drugs (extrapyramidal effects, weight gain and tiredness), which may improve quality of life. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of 20 weeks of resistance training and concurrent training on psychotic and depressive symptoms, quality of life and serum IGF-1 concentration., Physical exercise|Schizophrenia|symptoms|IGF-1
1	Trial of Propranolol in Adults and Adolescents With ASD and Predictors of Response, The investigators' specific aim is to examine the effects of serial doses of propranolol on social interaction, and secondarily on language tasks, anxiety, adaptive behaviors, and global function in high functioning adults and adolescents with autism in a double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. The investigators will also examine whether response to treatment can be predicted based upon markers of autonomic functioning, such as skin conductance and heart rate variability, and whether anxiety predicts treatment response. The investigators' hypothesis is that social functioning and language abilities will benefit from serial doses of propranolol, as the investigators have demonstrated in previous single-dose studies. The investigators also predict that those with the greatest degree of autonomic dysregulation will demonstrate the greatest benefit from the drug., Propranolol

2	Diagnostic Announcement to Relatives of Patients With Schizophrenia, Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder that affects 1% of the population worldwide. The diagnostic announcement of this chronic disorder is an essential step in the patient's care. Recommendations specify the importance of including caregivers at the time of the announcement. In practice, caregivers are not systematically associated with the announcement of the diagnosis of schizophrenia, while the daily support of patients is provided in 75% of cases by the family. This support can lead to the exhaustion of caregivers and have repercussions on their sick loved one.||This study will qualitatively describe and explore the experience of the diagnostic announcement in relatives of patients with schizophrenia. Specifically, the investigators will explore the history before the diagnosis is announced, the conditions of the announcement and the experiences of relatives as well as the impact at the personal and family-levels. This study will also explore the expectations of caregivers and avenues for reflection for announcement of schizophrenia diagnosis.||The number of subjects to be included in this study is therefore set at 30. A preselection of each potential participant will be carried out by phone or in person to ensure the presence of inclusion criteria and the absence of non-inclusion criteria. The patients will also be provided with oral information about the study to allow sufficient time to reflect before inclusion. Then, the selection-inclusion-interview visit will take place visually in an intra-hospital or extra-hospital consultation structure of the Center Hospitalier Alpes-Isère. This visit will be unique and will consist of the entire protocol. It will be both a selection, inclusion and interview visit.||Once the results have been analyzed, this study will provide a better understanding of the experiences of relatives of patients when the diagnosis of schizophrenia is announced, the impact of this announcement on caregivers and family relationships and the expectations of caregivers regarding this announcement. In the long term, the data collected will be add value in developing medical recommendations on consultation to announce the diagnosis of schizophrenia to relatives of patients, in order to best meet the expectations of relatives and to minimize as much as possible the harmful impact that can have such announcement., 0

1	Intranasal Oxytocin Treatment for Social Deficits in Children With Autism, In recent years, the neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) has been implicated in a wide range of social behaviors including attachment bonds, emotion recognition, eye gaze to social cues, and memory for social information. Social impairments represent one of the most intractable features of autism, and evidence now suggests that OT biology is dysregulated in individuals with this disorder. The central aim of the research outlined here is to test whether OT administration to children with autism increases their quality and quantity of social interactions and enhances their ability to process emotional and social information. Findings from initial single-dose OT administration studies in teenaged and adult males with autism have shown improvement in some aspects of social functioning, but replication and extension to well-controlled treatment trials with younger male and female subjects is necessary to evaluate effectiveness. We therefore aim to investigate the effect of intranasal OT on social cognition and behavior immediately following a single-dose (24IU) and following a 4-week period of OT (24IU BID) administration in a sample of 50 subjects with autism aged 6 to 12 years. The primary outcome for this study is change in social behavior, as determined by parent ratings on the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) after the 4-week treatment period. Secondary outcomes are changes in functioning on laboratory-based measures of social behavior and cognition following single-dose and 4-week OT administration. Research in a small study sample (N=13) also identified treatment responders and non-responders to a single-dose of OT. Thus, we also aim to identify biological and cognitive and behavioral variables (i.e., pretreatment levels of social functioning and pretreatment plasma hormone levels) that may influence treatment response efficacy in our larger study sample. On completion of the 4-week treatment period all subjects will have the option of participating in another 4-week double-blind trial in which they will be switched to the alternate nasal spray to that which they previously received. They will then undergo a fourth and final assessment time-point using the same testing procedures as outlined above on completion of the 4-week dosing. By providing subjects with the option of participating in a second 4-week treatment trial, all subjects will have an opportunity to receive the active oxytocin nasal spray. We also will be able to examine any ongoing effects of oxytocin treatment in the group receiving placebo during the second 4-week administration period. Subjects not willing to take part in the second trial will exit the study and will be referred to their treating physician., 0
1	"Intranasal Oxytocin in the Treatment of Autism, Autism is a developmental disorder characterized by abnormalities in speech and communication, impaired social functioning, and repetitive behaviors and restricted interests. A number of researchers have suggested that the neuropeptide oxytocin may be implicated in the etiology of autism.||Given the likely possibility of dysregulated oxytocin in autism, the goal of this pilot study is to investigate the long-term therapeutic effects of oxytocin in the treatment of autism. One practical issue with oxytocin is that it does not exist in a pill form. Only the intravenous form is available in the United States and this form may or may not pass the blood-brain barrier. In addition, intravenous oxytocin is not practical for treatment studies. One alternative is intranasal oxytocin; this form of administration is known to pass the blood-brain barrier, and it is easy for participants to self-administer. Although not available in the United States, we are in the process of receiving an Investigational New Drug exemption for its use and can import it from Europe.||Thus, this pilot investigation will explore daily intranasal oxytocin in the treatment of autism. Also, there are very few, if any, outcome measures to assess social functioning in the ""real world"" in the context of clinical trials; yet, this is a major target for intervention, especially in autism. Thus, a final goal of this study will be to explore the use of Event Contingent Recording to index changes in social functioning and affect. Event Contingent Recording is a methodology developed by personality/social psychologists, which allows participants to report on symptoms, affect, and behavior close in time to experience. In addition, to enabling more sensitive assessments, this methodology allows for the assessment of more diverse (e.g., at home versus work) and more detailed measurements of mood and behavior.||Finally, a portion of this study aims to perform gene expression profiling using fresh whole blood to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying oxytocin therapy and oxytocin efficacy in adults with high functioning autism or Asperger's syndrome. The systemic effects of oxytocin therapy and the molecular basis for a positive treatment response to oxytocin are not well understood. An understanding of the former may help predict those persons who may suffer side-effects from treatment and the latter may help provide easily accessible peripheral biomarkers that could predict treatment response., Autism|Treatment|Oxytocin|Adults|Autism Spectrum Disorder"
2	A Trial to Explore the Tolerability, Safety and Efficacy of Paliperidone Extended Release in Patients With Schizophrenia, This is a single arm (the same intervention is given to all patients), multicenter study that aimed to explore the tolerability, safety and efficacy of flexibly dosed paliperidone extended release (ER) among Filipino patients with schizophrenia who have not taken any antipsychotics in the past, and among newly diagnosed schizophrenia patients who have not taken any antipsychotics for at least one month prior to screening. Antipsychotics are drugs that are helpful in the treatment of psychosis and have a capacity to ameliorate thought disorders. Flexible dosing allows the investigators to adjust the dosage of each patient based on the individual needs., Schizophrenia|Paliperidone ER|Treatment naive patients|Newly diagnosed patients

2	High Dose D-Serine as Adjuvant Treatment for Recent Onset Schizophrenia, Background: Recent advances in understanding the neurobiology underlying schizophrenia have underscored a pivotal role for a specific receptor for the neurotransmitter glutamate, the NMDA receptor, whose function may be impaired in the disorder. Enhancing transmission at the NMDA receptor may therefore provide a novel mechanism for treating schizophrenia. Over the past decade clinical trials that included supplementation with different compounds enhancing transmission at the NMDA receptor have provided positive results, particularly with D-serine. However, none of these trials focused specifically on young patients with recent onset schizophrenia. In addition, the optimal D-serine dose was not determined, although a preliminary report suggested that higher doses than those used in most studies may provide additional benefit, without significant safety concerns or side effects. Also, the pro-cognitive effects of D-serine were not systematically analyzed, although preliminary data supports a potential role for D-serine in ameliorating the cognitive deficits found in schizophrenia.||Research Design: Over a two year period, 54 patients, male or female, aged 18-30 years who fulfill DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, will be entered into a 12 week, parallel group, double blind, randomized controlled trial assessing the efficacy of placebo vs. DSR (up to 6000 mg/day) augmentation to standard antipsychotic therapy. First episode patients, and patients treated with clozapine, will be randomized separately. Patients will be entered into the trial in accordance with strict inclusion and exclusion criteria after the nature of the study has been explained to them and they have given written informed consent. Clinical evaluations will be performed at baseline and then at regular intervals during the trial. In addition, neurocognitive evaluations, electrophysiological assessments and determination of amino acids levels will be conducted at the beginning and end of the study. Treatment emergent adverse effects will be monitored., Schizophrenia|NMDA receptor|D-serine|Recent onset|Negative symptoms|Cognition
2	Combination of NMDA-enhancing and Anti-inflammatory Treatments for Schizophrenia, Several lines of evidence suggest that both NMDA and inflammatory hypotheses have been implicated in schizophrenia. Previous studies found that some NMDA-enhancing agents were able to augment efficacy of antipsychotics in the treatment of chronic schizophrenia. In addition, several drugs with anti-inflammatory properties have been tested in clinical trials for the treatment of schizophrenia too. Whether a drug with anti-inflammatory property can strengthen the efficacy of an NMDA-enhancer (NMDAE) in the treatment of schizophrenia remains unknow. Therefore, this study aims to compare NMDAE plus a drug with anti-inflammatory property and NMDAE plus placebo in the treatment of schizophrenia. The subjects are the patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia who have responded poorly to two or more kinds of antipsychotics treatment. They keep their original treatment and are randomly, double-blindly assigned into two treatment groups for 12 weeks: (1) NMDAE plus Anti-inflammatory Agent (AIFA), or (2) NMDAE plus placebo. Clinical performances and side effects are measured at weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12. Cognitive functions are assessed at baseline and at endpoint of treatment by a battery of tests. The efficacies of NMDAE plus AIFA and NMDAE plus placebo will be compared.||Chi-square (or Fisher's exact test) will be used to compare differences of categorical variables and t-test (or Mann-Whitney test if the distribution is not normal) for continuous variables between treatment groups. Mean changes from baseline in repeated-measure assessments will be assessed using the generalized estimating equation (GEE). All p values for clinical measures will be based on two-tailed tests with a significance level of 0.05., Schizophrenia|NMDA|Inflammation

2	Cerebral Impact of Cognitive Remediation for People Suffering From Schizophrenia, Among cognitive deficits associated to schizophrenia, the jumping to conclusion bias is a frequent consequence of the decision making process alteration. This bias is characterized by a fast decision making when probabilistic judgments would be necessar.||Cognitive remediation aims at reducing the impact of cognitive deficits. The program that will be used in the present study focuses on the jump to conclusion bias. In schizophrenia, the positive impact of programs targeting such a bias, and more generally social cognition, has already been shown in numerous studies. However, despite the fact that jumping to conclusion is one of the main goals of these programs, their effects on decision making are poorly investigated in literature.||The program should impact decision making and reduce the jumping to conclusion bias. The benefits will probably be linked with a change in the P300 signal. They will probably appear earlier and with bigger amplitudes., Schizophrenia|Cognitive remediation|Jumping to Conclusion
2	Evaluation of Stroop Effect in Patients With Schizophrenia, First, participants will receive six categories of stimuli presented in a classical way: (1) incongruous stimulus classical (BLUE written in green for example); (2) associated incongruous stimuli (SKY written in green for example); (3) conventional congruent stimuli (BLUE written in blue for example); (4) associated congruent stimuli (SKY written in blue for example); (5) neutral words (BRIDGE written in green for example); And (6) neutral stimulus (XXXX written in green for example).||In a second step (after a 5 minute break), they will receive these six categories of stimuli, but only half will be presented in a classic way and the other half will be presented in order to attract attention as in Augustinova and Ferrand 2007). To do this, in (1) incongruous stimuli classical like BLUE, a single letter (like B for example) will be colored in green for example and the rest of the word (LUE) will appear in gray); In (2) incongruous stimuli associated as SKY, only K for example will be green and the rest of the word will appear in gray); In (3) conventional congruent stimuli such as BLUE, only B for example will be written in blue and the rest of the word will appear in gray); In (4) associated congruent stimuli such as SKY only K for example will be written in blue and the rest of the word will appear in gray); In (5) neutral words like BRIDGE, only D will be colored in green for example and the rest of the word will appear in gray; And finally, in (6) neutral stimuli like XXXX, only one X will be colored in green for example and the rest of the X will appear in gray.||The task will be to name the color of each word (by stating the color verbally) as quickly and correctly as possible, while ignoring the written word. In this experiment, we will measure the time taken to denominate the color (in milliseconds) as well as the percentages of incorrect answers.||The first step allows to determine the stroop effect and the second the semantic conflict., Schizophrenia|Stroop effect|Semantic conflict|Response conflict

2	Improving Work Outcome in People With Recent-onset Schizophrenia, The purpose of this protocol is to test, in recent-onset schizophrenia, the efficacy of a rehabilitative intervention that is designed to enhance the search for appropriate work or schooling and to increase ability to maintain work or school activities more successfully. Predictors of work outcome are being assessed in the context of this work rehabilitation and treatment with the second-generation antipsychotic medication, risperidone.||The Developmental Processes in Schizophrenic Disorders project involves an ongoing series of longitudinal follow-through studies of individuals with a recent onset of schizophrenia. The current protocol focuses particularly on processes affecting work outcome in this initial period after onset of schizophrenia, drawing on findings that link cognitive deficits in schizophrenia to functional outcome. The protocol is determining the effects on work outcome of a rehabilitative intervention designed to enhance search for appropriate work or schooling and to increase ability to maintain work or school activities more successfully. All entering patients are placed on a common antipsychotic medication, oral risperidone, and are provided clinical treatment by a psychiatrist and a case manager. Participating patients are randomly assigned to a combination of Individual Placement and Support (IPS) and group training with the Workplace Fundamentals Module or to a Brokered Vocational Rehabilitation Model.||The protocol is examining the predictors of level of work functioning attained in the context of the work-focused intervention and maintenance on risperidone. Potential neurocognitive and environmental predictors of work and social functioning and clinical course are being examined. Aspects of early perceptual processing, allocation of attention, working memory, secondary verbal memory, and conceptual flexibility that are implicated as influences on functional outcome are assessed, as are potential stresses and supportive influences in the environment., work outcome|supported employment|social skills training|risperidone|cognition|first-episode schizophrenia
2	"Evaluation of the Role of Neurodegeneration in Schizophrenia, Schizophrenia is a progressive and complex psychiatric disorder with a lifetime prevalence of 1%, usually diagnosed between the ages of 20-25, its etiology is not fully understood, and it progresses with relapses. In addition to positive symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech and behavior, and negative symptoms such as affective blunting, anhedonia, and avulsion, impairment in social and occupational functionality and cognitive impairment can be observed.||The incidence of schizophrenia in relatives of individuals with schizophrenia is higher than in the general population. Although heredity is a strong component in the etiology of schizophrenia, environmental exposures and stressors such as maternal immune infection, obstetric complications, childhood trauma and cannabis exposure also play a role in the development and neuropathology of the disease. Hereditary risk and the interactions of these exposures with the genomic sequence form the basis of the neurodevelopmental hypothesis of schizophrenia.||The neurodevelopmental hypothesis proposes that disruption of brain development early in life is responsible for the onset of symptoms. According to the neurodevelopmental hypothesis, although the biological changes and other features of the disease are present in the patient long before the onset of the characteristic symptoms of schizophrenia, these symptoms will not appear in the patient until a certain level of development is reached by interacting with some factors.||Detection of some brain findings such as decreased cortical volume, ventricular enlargement, and altered gyrification patterns in the imaging findings in the initial period of schizophrenia supports the view that some changes in the brain can be seen even before the onset of schizophrenia, but in this view, no worsening of the damage in the brain is expected. Therefore, the neurodevelopmental model falls short of addressing the progressive brain damage observed in patients with chronic schizophrenia Studies show a worsening clinical course in 60% of patients with schizophrenia. The neurodegenerative hypothesis focuses on the fact that biochemical changes in schizophrenia are characterized by chronic and progressive impairment of the nervous system, leading to different clinical syndromes, loss of neurological function and behavioral disorders. It is thought that the presence of changes in the brain morphology of patients with schizophrenia in various studies indicates degeneration. In brain imaging, changes such as decrease in temporal lobe and frontal lobe volume, enlargement in the lateral ventricles and third ventricle, hippocampal atrophy have been detected. Changes in these areas of the brain indicate loss of white and gray matter. Detection of these differences in the first psychotic attacks and early-onset patients; suggests that the degenerative process starts from the earliest stages of the disorder. In addition, it has been shown that the difference between brain imaging of healthy controls and patients with schizophrenia increases with age.||Following the clinical onset of schizophrenia, patients differ significantly in disease course. Relapse is associated with significant psychological and social distress as well as increased economic burden in patients with schizophrenia and their families. Good response to antipsychotic drug and low optimal antipsychotic dose in patients with first episode schizophrenia; This suggests that relapse reduces drug response, and that the increase in the number of attacks is associated with resistance to treatment in schizophrenia. The state of not responding adequately to treatment is defined as resistance to treatment, and the most comprehensive definition of the concept of Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia (TFS) was made by Kane, and it was named ""Kane Criteria"". Kane Criteria Criteria for resistance to treatment applied in the past; Failure to respond to at least three antipsychotic treatments at 1000mg/day chlorpromazine or equivalent dose for six weeks in the previous five years. Lack of a good functioning period in the last five years. Criterion of severity of psychopathology; A Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) score of 45 and above, At least two of the 4 positive symptoms of BPRS (thought disorientation, skepticism, hallucinatory behavior, unusual thoughts) are 4 and above, Clinical General Impression (CGI) score is 4 and above Prospective treatment non-response criteria; Unresponsive to haloperidol therapy up to 60 mg/day. (Response to treatment was defined as a BPRS score of more than 20% and a CGI score of 3 or less, or a BPRS score of 35 or less). Diagnosis of Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia in Clinical Practice - A history of two antipsychotic treatments - At least 6 weeks on an antipsychotic and at least 600 mg Chlorpromazine equivalent dose - Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (CPRS) ≥45 - Positive and Negative Syndrome Global Scale (PANNS) ≥75 - Clinical Impression Scale-Severity of Disease (CGI-HȘ) ≥ 4 - General Evaluation of Functioning (IGD) ≤50 In psychiatry, the diagnosis is made based on the evaluation of signs and symptoms in the clinical interview, and there is no biological ""gold standard"" diagnosis. It has been shown that in patients with first episode schizophrenia, each episode lasts longer than the previous episode, and relapse is associated with progressive loss of cortical tissue and brain volume. Relapse is an expression of worsening psychopathology and it is thought that some neurobiological pathways may cause relapse. The glial fibrillary acidic protein GFAP, which is one of the reactive astrocyte-specific biomarkers indicating astrogliosis, is not released from the healthy astrocyte. The increase in GFAP indicates damage and inflammation in the astrocyte. It is also secreted in different amounts from different parts of the brain. GFAP can be measured in serum in proportion to the degree of damage by passing into the blood circulation as a result of astrocyte damage. One of the cytoskeletal components (GFAP), it has been associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and is thought to play a role in the etiology of schizophrenia and is one of the potential markers of neurodegeneration and progression in schizophrenia. In a study measuring the amount of serum GFAP in patients with schizophrenia and healthy volunteers, GFAP was found to be high in the schizophrenia group, but it was noted that it was higher especially in patients using clozapine.||The S100B protein is a member of the calcium-binding protein group and is secreted from many cells, such as astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, certain neuronal populations, adipocytes, or lymphocyte populations. This protein is released from stimulated or damaged astrocytes into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and crosses the blood-brain barrier and enters the peripheral circulation. The S100B protein (depending on its level) can have a trophic or toxic effect on surrounding neurons, astrocytes, or microglia. At low concentration, S100B ensures neuron survival, but at higher level it leads to neuronal cell apoptosis and is associated with brain damage or neurodegeneration. Various brain tumors, neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders, psychiatric diseases and even major cardiac events have been investigated. Serum and cerebrospinal concentrations of S100B are found to be high in schizophrenia, which is thought to indicate activation of astrocytes or loss of oligodenrocytes. Studies in cell culture and experiments with ligands have shown that S100B can increase dopaminergic neurotransmission. With the pathogenesis of the disease, varying concentrations of S100B in patients with schizophrenia; It is thought that the binding of S100B to the D2 receptor leads to a decrease in glutamate concentration at synapses as a result of increased signal transduction and increased glutamate uptake in astrocytes, and may also be related to the role of S100B in neuronal apoptosis in many different ways.||Data Collection and Evaluation Scales||Sociodemographic and Clinical Data Form:|The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS)|Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)|Clinical Global Impression (CGI)|General Evaluation of Functioning (IGD)|STANDARDIZED MINI MENTAL TEST (SMMT) or MODIFIED MINI MENTAL TEST (MMSE-E) FOR THE UNEDUCTED, schizophrenia, neurodegeneration, s100b, gfap"
1	Treatment With Acetyl-Choline Esterase Inhibitors in Children With Autism Spectrum Disorders, Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are a group of developmental disorders of brain function resulting in a distinct phenotype, most probably related to many specific causes. Individuals with a disorder in the autism spectrum are a heterogeneous group of patients with early childhood onset of deficits in social interaction, communication and language, and repetitive and stereotypic behaviors. ASD has become increasingly prevalent during the last few decades (Wiznitzer, 2005).||The neuro-anatomical substrate of ASD has been the subject of intense investigation, but current findings are inconclusive, limited and sometimes even contradictory.||Medical treatment of autism is still a matter of dispute. Medications used are mainly aimed to treat the comorbid symptoms, such as epilepsy, tics, obsessive-compulsive or hyperactive behaviors (Wiznitzer, 2005). Although many efforts were invested in establishing a model of autistic pathophysiology, no such model is currently accepted, and there is no evidence for an efficient treatment of the core autistic symptoms (Wiznitzer, 2005).||Previous studies indicate that many brain systems are involved in the expression of autism. Specifically, it has been suggested that autism involves neurotransmitter dysregulations (Lam et al, 2006). A recent investigation of the cholinergic system in autism, detailed below, has provided promising findings. Our study aims to assess the clinical outcomes associated with cholinergic manipulations using pharmacological agents and nutritional supplements. The study approved by the Helsinki committee for clinical research., Autism
2	Anti-Inflammatory Challenge in Schizophrenia, This research project will explore negative symptoms of schizophrenia, such as motivational deficits, by examining the relationship between inflammation and reward-related brain regions. To accomplish this, we will administer a single infusion of either the anti-inflammatory medication infliximab or placebo (n=10 per group) to patients with high inflammation.||This study is important because schizophrenia can be a chronic and debilitating neuropsychiatric disorder and negative symptoms are some of the most difficult aspects of schizophrenia associated with worst functional outcomes. These symptoms do not typically respond to antipsychotic therapies, and as such, there are no current medications to treat negative symptoms.||Study procedures include 9 separate visits as follows:||Pre-screening Visit which includes questions about mood and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, blood sampling to measure CRP which is a marker of inflammation, a urine drug screen (UDS) and urine testing for pregnancy in all biological women (approx. 1-2 hours).|Screening Visit which includes assessing for adverse events, more detailed questions about symptoms, a physical exam, blood draw for medical safety screening labs, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) safety screening questionnaire, instruction and practice playing a computer game where the participant can earn money, and an electrocardiogram (EKG) to make sure the patient's heart is healthy.|Baseline Visit which includes assessing for adverse events, behavioral assessments, blood sampling for medical safety screening labs and research labs, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan where participant plays a computer game where s/he can earn extra money.

1	An fMRI Study of the Effect of Intravenous Oxytocin vs. Placebo on Response Inhibition and Face Processing in Autism, Autism is a developmental disorder affecting approximately 60/10,000 individuals. It is characterized by social and language deficits and repetitive behaviors/restricted interests. Functional imaging is becoming a very useful tool in trying to understand the neurobiology of autism. Oxytocin is a hormone produced by the brain to assist with labor and lactation. Recent evidence suggests that it may be involved in social attachment and in repetitive behaviors. In this project, we will study how oxytocin changes the way the brain of autistic adults processes faces, and deals with response inhibition (the ability to interrupt ongoing responses should they prove ineffective or interfering with attaining a goal). There is currently no functional imaging data assessing the effect of oxytocin on the brain. We will explore the activation patterns in response to oxytocin across circuits involved in social cognition (face fusiform area) and response inhibition (caudate, orbitofrontal and dorsolateral cortex) by administering a specific fMRI task activating those circuits before and during an oxytocin infusion. We will also explore the effect of oxytocin in these areas by administering specific cognitive testing not associated with fMRI before and during oxytocin infusion., 0
1	Oxcarbazepine Versus Placebo in Childhood Autism, The proposed study is designed to assess the effectiveness of treatment with Oxcarbazepine vs. placebo in childhood/adolescent autism. This is a twelve-week study involving twenty subjects between the ages of five and seventeen with a diagnosis of autism. Subjects will receive a psychiatric and medical evaluation by the study psychiatrist to see if she/he has any psychiatric or medical illnesses that would interfere with their ability to participate in this study. These evaluations may take up to an hour to complete. In addition, subjects will be asked to participate in a psychiatric interview designed to determine the child's diagnosis and current problem areas. The subject's parent will also be asked to fill out psychiatric questionnaires. The interview and questionnaires may take up to 4 hours to complete., Irritability|Functional Ability|Aggression|Mood Instability
0	Attention Bias Modification for Anxiety: A Randomized Control Trial With Biomarkers, Anxiety disorders are the most common psychiatric diagnosis, affecting as many as 29% of people during their lifetime. In addition to the devastating personal cost of anxiety, the yearly economic cost to society has been estimated to be around $46.6 billion in the U.S. Empirically-based treatments for anxiety have improved in recent years, but barriers to access, side effects, and high remission rates (~50%) suggest the need for complementary treatments. Computer-based attention bias modification treatment (ABMT), which is brief, cost-effective, and easy to administer, targets a key mechanism in pathological anxiety - the threat bias, or exaggerated attention feared or threatening stimuli. Two decades of research show that reducing threat bias via computerized ABMT also reduces anxiety severity at levels comparable to gold-standard treatments. Despite its promise, no randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have evaluated specific mechanisms underlying ABMT's effects on anxiety, nor identified predictors of treatment response. Therefore, it remains unclear how and for whom ABMT is effective, limiting clinical translation. This study is a randomized clinical trial using a highly sensitive measure of neurocognitive functioning to delineate key mechanisms of an emerging treatment for anxiety. Specifically, the study will use scalp-recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) to elucidate neurocognitive processes implicated in attention bias modification treatment (ABMT) and to predict treatment response. Researchers will recruit 90 anxious patients to engage in the study and pursue the following three specific aims: Aim 1 will examine relations between neural and behavioral responses to threat prior to ABMT. Researchers will test whether greater behavioral threat bias is associated with ERP responses indicating greater attention capture by threat (larger P1 and P2 ERPs), and reduced top-down control of attention to threat (smaller N2, N2pc, P3 ERPs). Aim 2 will examine the effects of ABMT on ERPs to threat, threat bias, and anxiety. Analyses will focus on whether ABMT relative to placebo training will result in greater reductions in automatic attention capture and/or controlled attention to threat measured via ERPs. Aim 3 will examine relations between ERP responses to threat and reductions in threat bias and anxiety. Researchers will test whether post-training neural changes, specified in Aim 2, will be associated with reductions in behavioral threat bias and anxiety severity. These predicted relations,together with those tested in Aim 2a, support the utility of these ERPs as neural markers for the specific cognitive processes underlying ABMT efficacy. Researchers will also explore whether ERP measures of greater attention capture and/or reduced control of attention to threat at baseline predict treatment response, helping identify which patients will benefit most from ABMT. Through the innovative combination of a highly sensitive neurocognitive measure and an RCT design, this proposal aims to delineate core neurocognitive responses to threat as mechanisms in the remediation of anxiety. Confirmation of study hypotheses would, ultimately, accelerate the pace of development of more biologically-informed, accessible, and targeted interventions for anxiety., attention bias modification, anxiety, event-related potentials
2	Multimodal Physical Therapy Program in Schizophrenia, It´s well known that life expectancy of people with severe mental disorders is approximately from 15 to 20 years less compared with general population. The higher mortality risk in this population group reflects a combination of factors: a) increased prevalence of comorbid medical conditions; b) adverse effects of pharmacological treatment; c) higher rates of suicide, accidental and other violent death; d) poorer access to physical healthcare than for the general population. In addition, this vulnerable population has an extremely high prevalence of obesity, nearly twice that of the overall population. Therefore, it is not surprising that persons with serious mental illness have an increased occurrence of weight-related conditions, including heightened risk of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and dyslipidaemia; in addiction to this, these pathologies are under-diagnosed and under-treated. Environmental issues and unhealthy lifestyle can account for all these conditions, particularly in people with SMI, such as high levels of cigarette smoking, unhealthy diet or sedentary life style. Tendency to isolation and a reduced social network are often obstacles to the practice of physical exercise.||In addition, antipsychotics, in particular atypical antipsychotics, have been associated with weight gain, dyslipidaemia, diabetes, and other cardiac risk factors. Furthermore, the side effects of these medications are one of the most significant barriers to changing their lifestyle.||Finally, the stigma associated with mental illness may also contribute to low levels of participation in mainstream leisure-time physical activities.||Regular practise of physical exercise improves physical and mental health in the general population. A recent systematic review of physical activity and schizophrenia has shown improvement in both positive and negative symptoms, and a general increase in wellbeing of people with schizophrenia. In addition to cardiac and metabolic effects, physical exercise has demonstrated an improvement in both depression and anxiety.||The main objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a multimodal physical activity programme in physical fitness and physical activity level in persons with a diagnosis of schizophrenia.||Secondary objectives are: Evaluate the effect of this intervention in clinical symptomatology; Analyse the effect of this programme in motivating these persons to undertake physical activity; Identify the effect of the program on the physical fitness of the subjects; Evaluate any influence of the program on the self-perception of stigma in the subjects; Evaluate any variation of level of physical activity before and after the study in the subjects; Measure the impact on the quality of life of people who participate in this study; Perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of the program.||The present study is a randomized clinical trial to compare the effect of a multimodal, individualized, physical programme of muscular strength, endurance, aerobic training and health education against a control group.||All variables will be measured at the beginning and the end of the 12-week program by the same evaluator, whose group of subjects will be randomly allocated to the trial group and control group without their knowledge. Furthermore, the variables will be measured 9 months after the end of the program. Subjects allocated to the control group will have all the same variables measured, and will be given the option to participate in the program once the study is completed., Schizophrenia|Mental Health|Physical Therapy|Quality of life|Stigma|Positive and negative symptoms|Physical fitness|Physical activity
2	A Safety and Tolerability Study of Paliperidone Palmitate Injected in the Shoulder or the Buttock Muscle in Patients With Schizophrenia, To date, all prior trials involving intramuscular injection of paliperidone palmitate were conducted with buttock administration. This is a randomized, multicenter, crossover design study in evaluating safety and tolerability of paliperidone palmitate in two different injection sites. The study hypothesis is that there will be no difference in safety and tolerability between buttock injection compared to shoulder injection at any of the three different doses of paliperidone palmitate. The patients will receive intramuscular injections of paliperidone palmitate in either their buttocks or in their shoulders, Schizophrenia|Intramuscular injection|Deltoid muscle|Gluteus muscle|Paliperidone palmitate

2	Treatment of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) Enhancers for Schizophrenia, We will measure clinical efficacy every 3 weeks during the treatment. At the beginning and the end of the trial,We will utilize a battery of tests to assess the effect of the treatment on cognitive functions.The side effect assessments are also performed every 3 weeks. Side effect assessments include Simpson-Angus Rating Scale for extrapyramidal side-effects, Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) for dyskinesia, and Barnes Akathisia Scale. Systemic side effects are reviewed by applying the Udvalg for Kliniske Undersogelser (UKU) Side-effects Rating Scale.

1	"Testing a Novel Speech Intervention in Minimally Verbal Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), The ability to communicate verbally is considered the most important prognostic indicator for children with ASD. If a child has not developed speech by age 5, it is generally considered unlikely that he or she will do so. Although a small number of cases of speech development in older children with ASD have been reported, the type and intensity of treatments used varied widely, suggesting little consensus regarding the likely mechanisms involved. A few preliminary studies have tested the efficacy of interventions that employed techniques such as orienting cues, behavioral strategies, and prompts for facilitating speech acquisition in minimally verbal children, though almost all tested their approaches in children under the age of 5 who would be classified as preverbal rather than minimally verbal.||Principal Investigator Gottfried Schlaug, MD, PhD oversees all aspects of study treatments for the interventional arm of this Autism Center of Excellence directed by Helen Tager-Flusberg of Boston University. The Intervention study's main objective is to compare the effectiveness of one novel treatment for minimally verbal children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), Auditory-Motor Mapping Training (AMMT) to a control intervention termed Speech Repetition Therapy (SRT), both of which were developed and piloted in Dr. Schlaug's laboratory. The aim of the present study is to test whether one of those treatments is more effective than the other in a group of 5;5 to 12;0 year olds.||Participants will be screened and undergo several tests at Boston University's (BU) Autism Center of Excellence. Those found eligible for the intervention ""Testing a novel speech intervention in minimally verbal children with ASD"" will be enrolled and undergo testing at BU, participate in MRI scanning at Massachusetts General Hospital's (MGH) Martinos Imaging Center, and will then be randomly assigned to either the AMMT or SRT group for treatment at BIDMC. Before the intervention begins, participants will have up to 5 Baseline testing sessions (approx. 45-60 min./session) to (1) determine their ability to repeat a set of high-frequency 2-syllable words/phrases (e.g., Hello and All done), and (2) obtain an inventory of speech sounds that they are able to produce prior to treatment.||The intervention consists of 25 one-on-one therapy sessions during which children will be working toward producing (or approximating) a set of high-frequency 2-syllable words/phrases (e.g., ""More, please"", ""Mommy"", ""All done"", etc.). Progress will be monitored several times during the treatment phase as well as immediately after the 25 sessions and 4-weeks later. The total time commitment for the Intervention portion of the study will be approximately 6-8 weeks (i.e., approx. 1 week (±) for Baseline testing; approx. 5 weeks (5 sessions/week) for treatment; and approx. 1 week (±) for several mid- and post-treatment testing sessions). Upon completion of the intervention at BIDMC, participants will undergo post-treatment testing at BU and follow-up MRI at MGH's Martinos Imaging Center.||Results of this study will not only help determine if one of the two interventions is effective by comparing post-treatment assessments to baseline assessments but will also compare the experimental treatment (AMMT) versus the control treatment (SRT) to examine whether or not one is more effective than the other., minimally-verbal|children|intervention|singing|music"
2	Imaging of Brain Receptors in Healthy Volunteers and in Patients With Schizophrenia, Abnormalities of nicotinic acetylcholine system in schizophrenia are implied by the high prevalence of cigarette smoking. Because animal and human studies have shown that nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) play an important role in cognitive function, cognitive deficits in schizophrenia also suggest abnormalities in these receptors. Postmortem studies showed abnormalities in high affinity nAChRs in these patients but the direction of the abnormalities (increase or decrease) were not consistent probably because it is difficult to control the effects of cigarette smoking and neuroleptics in such studies. In vivo imaging studies are necessary to study relationship between nAChRs and psychiatric symptoms including cognitive impairments.||We plan to use a new single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) tracer, [(123)I]5-I-A-85380, which appears suitable for imaging the high affinity Alpha 4 Beta 2 subtype of nAChRs. We plan to compare four groups, 1) schizophrenia smokers, 2) schizophrenia non-smokers, 3) healthy smokers, and 4) healthy non-smokers. All patients will be on stable doses of olanzapine or risperidone. In addition to comparing [(123)I]5-I-A-85380 binding among these groups, relationship will be studied between psychiatric symptoms or cognitive dysfunction and the SPECT measurement of the receptors. Further, to study the reliability of the SPECT measurement, a test retest study will be preformed in healthy subjects with a wide range. The proposed study will explore the roles of nAChRs in the psychiatric symptoms, particularly the cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, which is the central impairment of this disorder. New findings in this research will lead to enhanced treatment of the cognitive deficits., Schizophrenia|SPECT|Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors|Cigarette Smoking|Cognitive Dysfunction|Reproducibility|Quantification|Healthy Volunteer|HV
2	Using D-cycloserine to Enhance the Benefits of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Schizophrenia, Schizophrenia is a debilitating chronic condition that affects approximately 1 % of Americans, who experience symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, and disorders of thought and movement. These symptoms are described as positive symptoms, because they are experienced in addition to what healthy individuals experience. Negative symptoms, which are reductions in normal functioning, and cognitive deficits, which are problems in thinking, also plague people with schizophrenia. The negative symptoms and cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia are produced in otherwise healthy people by neurotransmitters inhibiting the glutamatergic N-methyl-d-aspartate NMDA receptors in the brain. This inhibition of NMDA receptors also causes intensification of psychotic symptoms in otherwise stabilized schizophrenic patients. The drug D-cycloserine partially excites NMDA receptors, and it has been used to help patients with anxiety disorders to overcome phobias while they are receiving cognitive behavioral therapy. This study will examine whether D-cycloserine can increase the cognitive flexibility of someone undergoing CBT and thereby enhance the therapy's ability to reduce a patient's belief in paranoid delusions, preoccupation with delusions, and related distress.||All participants will be screened to ensure proper diagnosis of schizophrenia without other conditions. Those who pass will be randomly assigned to receive either D-cycloserine first or a placebo pill first. One week after the screening, participants in the D-cycloserine group will be given the drug before a 1-hour session of simulated CBT treatment. Those in the placebo condition will receive a placebo pill before an identical session. Two weeks after the screening, both groups will be called back for another session of CBT, but the pills they receive will be switched. Those who received D-cycloserine the first week will receive placebo, and those who received placebo will receive D-cycloserine. The CBT sessions will attempt to increase cognitive flexibility in patients by asking them to provide alternate explanations for common situations. At screening, at the start of visits on the first and second weeks, and at a follow-up visit on the third week, participants will undergo a series of assessments, including interviews, computerized tests, and self-report measures. Belief in, preoccupation with, and distress caused by delusions, as well as degree of cognitive flexibility, will be assessed., Paranoid Schizophrenia|Paranoid Delusions|CBT|D-Cycloserine
2	Roflumilast Plus Antipsychotics Proof of Mechanism Study in Schizophrenia, The drug being tested in this study is called roflumilast. Roflumilast is being tested as an add-on treatment to second generation antipsychotics (SGA) to treat cognitive impairment in people with stable schizophrenia. This study will look at improvement in cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia in people who take roflumilast as an add-on to SGA.||The study will enroll approximately 22 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of three treatment groups-which will remain undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need) All participants will receive the following treatments at different periods throughout the study:||Roflumilast Dose A + SGA|Roflumilast Dose B +SGA|Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a tablet that looks like the study drug but has no active ingredient + SGA.||All participants will be asked to take one tablet at the same time each day throughout the study.||This single-centre trial will be conducted in the United Kingdom. The overall time to participate in this study is up to 64 days. Participants will make 2 screening visits to the clinic and then must be brought to the clinic every day for dosing during each of 3 Treatment Periods. Each Treatment Period will be 8 days in duration. All participants will also make 1 final visit 14 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment., Drug therapy
0	Attention Bias Modification Training in Youth With Subthreshold Impairing Anxiety, This study will collect preliminary data on Attention Bias Modification Training (ABMT) among clinic referred children and adolescents who display subthreshold impairing anxiety (SubImpAnx; anxiety & related impairment that fails to meet diagnostic criteria for an anxiety disorder). Traditional approaches to mental health service delivery cannot meet current demand. The inadequacies of traditional service delivery are magnified when viewed through the lens of impaired but undiagnosed youth. It is an unaddressed empirical question whether a least restrictive treatment can effectively reduce SubImpAnx in youth. Empirical efforts to address this issue are important because youths with SubImpAnx experience substantial impairment, are at high risk of escalation to full syndrome anxiety disorder, and pose a burden on the health care system.||This study will enroll 66 clinic referred children and adolescents (ages 8-16 years) who meet criteria for SubImpAnx. Participants will be randomly assigned to complete 8 sessions of either ABMT or a placebo control (PC) task over 4 weeks. Clinician ratings on youth anxiety severity and impairment will be evaluated as the primary outcome. Youth self ratings and parent ratings on youth anxiety symptoms and impairment will be evaluated as secondary outcomes. All measures will be collected before condition assignment (pretreatment), at immediate posttreatment, and at an 8 week follow up. In addition, initial data will be collected to shed light on whether it would be useful to pursue (a) attention bias to threat as a mediator of ABMT's anxiety reduction effects and (b) dose-response issues related to ABMT's anxiety reduction effects in a subsequent, larger study.||The specific aims are: Collect pilot data on the effects of ABMT and a PC task on levels of anxiety and impairment at a post evaluation (Aim 1) and at a follow up (FU) evaluation 8 weeks after the post evaluation (Aim 2); Preliminarily examine whether ABMT leads to lower levels of attention bias toward threatening stimuli as compared to a PC Task at post and 8 week FU (Aim 3); Describe the course of anxiety symptoms and impairment during treatment among youth in the ABMT condition (Aim 4).||This project will provide critically needed pilot data on ABMT for youth with SubImpAnx. With these data in hand, the field will be in a better position to determine whether ABMT may be used as a least restrictive intervention among anxious youth who are 'impaired but undiagnosed.', 0

0	Brief Anxiety Skills Training Intervention for Veterans in Primary Care, Background/Rationale: Many Veteran primary care patients experience impairing symptoms of anxiety, but rates of behavioral treatment are low. Primary Care-Mental Health Integration (PCMHI), in which mental health clinicians embedded in primary care provide brief treatment, affords an opportunity to address this treatment gap. However, behavioral interventions that are compatible with the brief PCMHI treatment format and able to accommodate a wide range of anxiety presentations are needed. Accordingly, Veterans Anxiety Skills Training (VAST) was designed to be evidence-based, transdiagnostic, feasible for PCMHI, and Veteran-centered. VAST consists of empirically-supported cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques adapted into a manualized modular intervention specifically designed for delivery in PCMHI.||Objectives: The specific aims of this study are to: (1) Compare patient clinical outcomes for VAST vs. PCMHI usual care between baseline and 16 weeks (post), and also examine whether treatment gains are more likely to be maintained for VAST vs. PCMHI usual care at 28 weeks (follow-up); (2) For participants receiving VAST, explore patient-level predictors of (a) early (8 weeks) and (b) overall (16 weeks) treatment response; and (3) Conduct a mixed-methods process evaluation of VAST implementation to examine rates of, barriers to, and facilitators of achieving and sustaining high-fidelity intervention delivery.||Methods: In this multi-site, hybrid type I effectiveness-implementation randomized clinical trial, 178 adult Veterans with elevated anxiety symptoms will be recruited from primary care at the Syracuse and Western New York VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community-Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). PCMHI providers will be randomized to deliver either VAST or usual care (routine PCMHI care, meaning whatever care the provider deems appropriate), and Veteran participants will be randomized to condition. VAST (up to six 30-minute sessions) consists of a standard initial and final session as well as up to 4 cognitive-behavioral skills modules. The primary outcome (Overall Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale [OASIS]) and secondary outcomes (anxiety and depressive symptom severity, functioning, quality of life, suicidality) will be assessed at baseline, 16 weeks (post) and 28 weeks (follow-up). Symptom severity and impairment will also be assessed at 4, 8, and 12 weeks as part of Aim 2. The fidelity of VAST delivery by PCMHI providers will be measured and tracked, and VAST providers will complete semi-structured interviews at the beginning and end of the study.||Analytic plan: Multi-level modeling will be used to evaluate the hypothesis that patient clinical outcomes will improve more from baseline to post (16 weeks) for participants receiving VAST compared to PCMHI usual care. The primary analysis will be conducted using the intention-to-treat approach. Multi-level modeling will also be used to examine group differences in the secondary outcomes at post (16 weeks) and the primary outcomes at follow-up (28 weeks). Multivariate logistic regression will be used to explore predictors of early (8 weeks) and overall (16 weeks) VAST treatment response (defined as a decrease of 4 or more points on the OASIS). A mixed-methods process evaluation will examine the proportion of PCMHI providers who achieve and sustain high-fidelity VAST delivery as well as barriers to and facilitators of high-fidelity delivery., anxiety|primary health care|Veterans

2	Proposal To Develop A Rapid And Cost-Effective Diagnostic Test For Schizophrenia, The overall objective of the study is to test the hypothesis that patients with schizophrenia will have a heightened tolerance to the sedating effects of antipsychotic medications, which will be reflected in differences in the participants' electroencephalogram response (EEG), when compared to healthy control participants.The following Specific Aims are designed to test this hypothesis and create the diagnostic tool.||Specific Aim 1: The investigators will first conduct a pilot dose-response evaluation of the anti-psychotic drugs ziprasidone (Geodon) (20, 40, or 60 mg tablet) and olanzapine (Zyprexa®) (2.5, 5, 7.5, or 10 mg tablet) in non-psychiatric ill control participants to determine the optimal dosage that promotes sedation in healthy participants versus a placebo. The evaluation will comprise of a physical examination and questionnaires. The investigators will start with the lowest dose of each drug and if the dosage fails to induce sedation in healthy participants, the investigators will repeat the pilot dose-response evaluation with the next higher dose until the maximum dose is reached for both drugs. Specific Aim 2. To determine whether the pattern of EEG activity in response to a single dose of the anti-psychotic medication determined from the dose-response study from Aim 1 distinguishes schizophrenia participants from normal controls. The investigators will start with 2-4 healthy control participants to determine that the results show a discernible effect on the EEG using the dosage from Aim 1. If the dose of anti-psychotic medication fails to show an effect on the EEG the investigators will increase the dosage until the maximum dosage of the chosen medication is used. Once the dosage is identified the investigators will move onto getting IRB approval to evaluate participants diagnosed with schizophrenia., schizophrenia, psychosis, ziprasidone, olanzapine
0	Anxiety Reduction Treatment for Acute Trauma, The purpose of the proposed research is to pilot a behavioral intervention specifically designed to reduce the symptoms of peritraumatic panic, in order to reduce the likelihood of subsequent PTSD. The investigators have developed the Anxiety Reduction Treatment for Acute Trauma (ARTAT), a one-session intervention targeting at-risk individuals (those continuing to experience peritraumatic panic following a trauma) and enhance self-efficacy. The intervention provides education about common responses to trauma in order to normalize symptoms and teaches individuals anxiety management techniques such as deep breathing and muscle relaxation. ARTAT specifically avoids encouraging people to process the trauma (given evidence that this may enhance arousal).||This study is a randomized controlled trial of a single session 60- minute Anxiety Reduction Treatment for Acute Trauma (ARTAT) administered during Emergency Department (ED) admission to patients presenting with anxiety following traumatic exposure. Thirty-six participants will be enrolled over a 12-month period (18 receiving ARTAT and 18 receiving TAU). The study will target anxious arousal in patients immediately (1 to 8 hours) following a trauma. Participants will be recruited from among patients who present in the Bellevue Emergency Department for treatment of an injury sustained in a traumatic event (accident, assault) as long as injuries do not preclude participation. Participants included in the study will have experienced a trauma within 8 hours and presenting with signs of a strong risk factor for PTSD: peritraumatic panic (severe psychological and physiological anxiety symptoms such as fear of dying, fear of losing emotional control, tachycardia, sweating, shaking and dissociation symptoms such as derealisation and depersonalization that occur during and immediately following a trauma. Following the initial assessment, eligible participants will be randomized to receive the one-hour anxiety-reduction intervention designed to reduce anxiety and panic symptoms through education and anxiety y management skills or the TAU. The clinician administered and self-report assessments will be conducted at screening, baseline, post-treatment, and at a one-month and three-month follow-up., Anxiety, Acute Trauma

Assessment was to be based on a comparison of randomized LY2140023-treated patients with those on placebo, as measured by the maximum of the 3-day moving average of the patient's total score on the Discontinuation Symptom Checklist-Modified Rickels (DSCMR)., schizophrenia, LY2140023, pomaglumetad methionil
2	Treatment Strategy for Refractory Schizophrenia: Drug Interaction Between Clozapine and Fluvoxamine, Background Schizophrenia is one of the most severe mental illnesses. The prevalence of schizophrenia has been variously reported as ranging from 1 to 1.5 percent. More than 50% of patients can be described as having a poor outcome, with repeated hospitalizations, exacerbations of symptoms, episodes of major mood disorders, and suicide attempts. Schizophrenia is costly in medical care, treatment and rehabilitation, and reduced or lost productivity. Therefore, the development of effective treatment for schizophrenic patients is an important issue.||The classical antipsychotic drugs are the dopamine receptor antagonists, which are effective in the treatment of schizophrenia, particularly of the positive symptoms. Even with treatment of typical antipsychotics, about 50% of schizophrenic patients lead severely debilitated lives. Second, the classical antipsychotic drugs are associated with annoying and serious adverse effects. Clozapine has been virtually the only psychopharmacological choice in patients with schizophrenia who either did not response to typical neuroleptics or experienced severe extrapyramidal side effects and consequently did not tolerate this medication. There are patients who do not respond to clozapine, and the need to treat these severely ill patients frequently compels clinicians to adopt therapeutic innovations that lack a sound empirical basis. One strategy is the combination of various other somatic treatments with clozapine.||Recently, the investigators conduct a preliminary open trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of fluvoxamine coadministration with clozapine in refractory schizophrenic patients. The mean plasma clozapine levels obtained by clozapine 100 mg/day plus fluvoxamine 50 mg/day is close to that produced by 300-mg/day clozapine monotherapy in one of our previous studies. The combined treatment is well tolerated, and clinical improvement is observed in our patients. And the concomitant fluvoxamine could attenuate the clozapine-induced weight gain and metabolic disturbance. However, the effects of fluvoxamine on the safety and therapeutic efficacy of clozapine need to be further clarified in double-blind study.||Methods This study is a three-year proposal. Sixty treatment-resistant schizophrenic inpatients will participate in this project. The subjects will be randomized to one of two parallel groups: clozapine monotherapy and clozapine plus fluvoxamine treatment. The double-blind active treatment will consist of two periods.||The measures of clinical efficacy will be the Positive And Negative Syndrome Scale, Clinical Global Impression, and Nurses'Observation Scale for Inpatient Evaluation. The measures of side effects will be the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale and the UKU Side Effect Rating Scale.

2	Evaluating Two Types of Cognitive Training in Veterans With Schizophrenia, Schizophrenia is a disorder that affects both higher-level neurocognitive operations (e.g., verbal memory, executive functioning) and lower-level perceptual processes (e.g., auditory processing). These deficits contribute to the poor community outcome and severe functional disability seen in patients. Effectively treating the cognitive dysfunction associated with this illness is important to achieve improvements in daily functioning. Recent meta-analytic studies report that cognitive training in schizophrenia has a moderate effect-size impact on cognitive functioning and a lower impact on daily functioning. However, most training interventions for schizophrenia have only targeted higher-order cognitive processes. A few recent interventions have targeted basic perceptual processing and shown that auditory and visual perceptual abilities can be trained and improved in patients with schizophrenia. These findings suggest that basic perceptual processing may be an ideal target for intervention. At this point, it is still unclear whether a neuroplasticity-based, bottom-up intervention is more effective than an intervention that targets top-down functions like attention, working memory, and executive functioning.||This clinical trial will contrast a bottom-up intervention targeting basic auditory processes and a top-down intervention targeting higher-order cognitive functions, compared with a control condition, in Veterans with schizophrenia. These interventions will be assessed by their effects on representative measures from three outcome domains: 1) neurocognition, 2) electroencephalography (EEG), and 3) functional capacity. Participants will be randomly assigned to the bottom-up auditory training, top-down cognitive training, or control treatment (commercial computer games). All treatments will be administered three times a week (1 hour each) for 12 weeks. A comprehensive battery of cognitive, electrophysiological, and functional measures will be administered at baseline, 6 weeks, and at completion of treatment. The investigators will enroll 120 Veterans with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder across the 5 years of the study.||This study will determine which training approach leads to the largest magnitude of improvement in neurocognition, functional capacity, and neural functioning measured with EEG. Moreover, it will shed light on the neural mechanisms underlying the response to training. By determining whether it is more beneficial to treat lower-level perceptual processes or higher-level cognitive functions, the results of this project will inform future recovery-based cognitive remediation interventions for Veterans with schizophrenia., cognitive training|schizophrenia|mismatch negativity|cognition|functional capacity|EEG

2	"Org 24448 (Ampakine) for Cognitive Deficits in Schizophrenia, This study is an eight-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, fixed dose trial comparing two doses of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) receptor positive modulator, Org 24448, added to a stable dose of atypical antipsychotic medication in 135 patients with schizophrenia studied at seven sites. The primary endpoint for this trial is a composite score derived from the MATRICS cognitive battery. Measures of psychiatric symptoms and functioning are secondary endpoints. Because previous trials in animals and humans with this and other AMPA modulators detected persistence of cognitive benefits, this trial will also repeat clinical assessments at follow-up, four weeks after completion of the study medication.||Primary Objective:||Compare the effects of an eight-week trial of Org 24448 250 mg BID, 500 mg BID and placebo upon cognitive function as assessed by the MATRICS cognitive battery.||Secondary Objectives:||Compare the effects of an eight-week trial of Org 24448 250 mg BID, 500 mg BID and placebo upon level of functioning as measured by the SCoRS and UPSA.|Compare effects of Org 24448 250 mg BID, 500 mg BID and placebo on overall symptoms measured by the BPRS total, psychotic symptoms measured by the BPRS positive symptom items, and negative symptoms measured by the SANS total.||Evaluate tolerability of Org 24448 250 mg BID and 500 mg BID compared to placebo measured by the Side Effect Checklist, AIMS, SAS, study completion rates, and frequency of abnormal laboratory values.||Tertiary Objective:||Evaluate persistence of effects on clinical ratings 4 weeks after completion of the 8-week trial.||Methods:||Study Locations: This study will be coordinated by the study PI, Dr. Goff, and the TURNS Treatment Management Unit under the direction of Dr. Buchanan. Patients will be recruited from the Massachusetts General Hospital and Massachusetts Mental Health Center in Boston (Dr. Goff), the Lemuel Shattuck Hospital and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (Dr. Seidman), the Nathan Kline Institute (Drs. Javitt and Nolan), Washington University Medical Center (Drs. Csernansky and Barch), the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center (Drs. Buchanan and Gold), Duke School of Medicine (Drs. McEvoy and Keefe), the University of California at Los Angeles (Drs. Marder and Green) and Columbia University (Drs. Lieberman and Kimhy). The TURNS is a NIMH-funded contract for the evaluation of new compounds for the treatment of cognitive impairments in schizophrenia (HHSN 27820044 1003C; P.I.: Steve Marder, M.D.). Data management will be performed by the Clinical Trials Data Management Unit of the Nathan Kline Institute under the direction of Jim Robinson, M.S., and statistical analysis will be performed by Dr. Robert McMahon of the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center. Org 24448 and matching placebo capsules will be provided by Organon Pharmaceuticals. Laboratory assays will be performed by Quest Diagnostics.||Subjects: Subjects will include 135 inpatients or outpatients with schizophrenia treated for at least 8 weeks with a stable dose of an atypical antipsychotic other than clozapine. Prior to enrollment, it will be determined that the clinician has optimized the dose of the antipsychotic and maintained the medication at a constant dose for at least 4 weeks. Diagnoses will be confirmed using the SCID. Patients will be excluded for significant medical illness, seizure disorder, substance abuse, or inability to provide informed consent. Because our primary hypothesis is that Org 24448 will improve measures of attention and memory, patients must be capable of completing the neuropsychological battery, but no minimum threshold of cognitive impairment is required for inclusion.||Screening: The diagnosis of schizophrenia will be confirmed by a research psychiatrist using a modified version of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM IV (SCID). The BPRS, SANS, CDRS and SAS will be administered to verify that inclusionary criteria are met. A physical examination, including neurological exam, will be performed and medical history, vital signs (weight, heart rate, oral temperature, sitting and standing blood pressure), and demographic information will be obtained. Laboratory assessments will include standard screening blood tests: electrolytes, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), fasting glucose, liver enzymes, T4, calcium, phosphate, magnesium, albumin and complete blood count (CBC) with differential and platelet count. A pregnancy test will be done in all premenopausal women. A routine urinalysis, drug screen, EKG and EEG with hyperventilation and photic stimulation will also be performed. The screening visits will collect all data required to complete inclusionary and exclusionary criteria except for performance on the MATRICS battery and WTAR, which will be administered as a baseline measurement at week 1 of the stabilization phase to minimize practice effects. In addition, subjects must continue to meet inclusionary and exclusionary criteria on baseline symptom ratings which will be performed at the completion of the stabilization phase (stabilization week 2).||Stabilization Phase: After informed consent is obtained and screening completed, subjects will enter a two-week, single-blind placebo lead-in stabilization phase. Placebo will be administered as two capsules twice daily dispensed in blister packs identical to those that will be used during the randomized, double-blind treatment phase. Baseline assessments will be completed during the stabilization phase and compliance with study medication will be assessed. Plasma will be obtained for assay of antipsychotic concentrations at week 2 of the stabilization phase. The plasma sample will be drawn as a trough level. This phase is intended to reduce placebo-response during the double-blind treatment phase, allow completion of baseline assessments, and provide an opportunity for investigators to identify and resolve potential problems with compliance.||The MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB), the Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR), the Schizophrenia Cognitive Rating Scale (SCoRS), and the University of California San Diego (UCSD) Performance-Based Skills Assessment (UPSA) will be completed at stabilization week 1; the clinical scales (described under ""Assessments"") will be completed at stabilization week 2.||Double-Blind Phase: Patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to placebo, Org 24448 250 mg BID or Org 24448 500 mg BID administered in identical-appearing capsules for eight weeks. Study drug will be dispensed weekly in blister packs containing placebo or Org 24448 250 mg capsules after completing the stabilization phase (stabilization week 2 and baseline assessments). Subjects will be given three extra days of medication in case of a missed appointment. All subjects will take two capsules twice daily. The antipsychotic dose will be unchanged during the trial. Patients will be asked to bring their previous blister pack to each visit; a count of remaining capsules will be performed and recorded. Patients will return for follow-up at week 12, four weeks after completing the double-blind trial. Investigators may reduce the morning (AM) dose of study drug by one capsule (250 mg) if necessary due to poor tolerance. Subjects may continue at the reduced dose or, after one week, the investigator may attempt to resume the full dose (two capsules BID). If the reduced dose (three capsules daily) is not tolerated, subjects will be discontinued from the study. Patients who miss 7 consecutive days of study drug or who are found to have taken 75% or fewer study doses at two or more pill counts will be dropped from study.||Assessments: The following scales will be completed at stabilization week 2 (baseline) and at weeks 2, 4, 6, 8 & 12 and will comprise the clinical assessment battery: Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS), Calgary Depression Rating Scale (CDRS) and Clinical Global Impression (CGI). In addition, the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) and the Simpson Angus Scale for Extrapyramidal Symptoms (SAS) will be performed at baseline and weeks 4, 8 & 12. Assessment of functioning will be performed at baseline, weeks 4 & 8 (or end of study) using the Schizophrenia Cognitive Rating Scale (SCoRS) and UCSD Performance-based Skills Assessment (UPSA). The SCoRS will be repeated at week 12. Cognitive functioning will be assessed at baseline, week 4 and week 8 (or end of study) using the MATRICS battery plus the NAB Daily Living Memory and a Delayed Recall Trial of the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test. A one-week window (up to 3 days before or 4 days after the scheduled visit) will be allowed for the completion of assessments to accommodate unusual or unavoidable circumstances only. All sites will be certified in the administration of the MATRICS, SCoRS and UPSA assessments prior to initiation of study. Inter-rater reliability will be established for the BPRS and SANS before the start of the study and will be reassessed every three months by the circulation of videotaped interviews.||Safety Assessments: Vital signs and the Side Effects Checklist will be performed and adverse events recorded weekly during the two-week stabilization phase and the 8 week trial and weekly for 4 weeks following completion of the trial . Laboratory assessments, including urinalysis, will be repeated at weeks 4, 6 and 8 (or end of study). An EKG will be repeated at weeks 2, 4 and 8. A white blood count (WBC) and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) will be repeated weekly during the 8 week trial and weekly for 4 weeks following completion of the trial. A physical examination, including neurological examination, will be repeated at week 8 (or end of study).Drug Plasma Concentrations: Plasma will be obtained at baseline and weeks 4 and 8 for assay of antipsychotic concentrations.

2	Brief Group Psychoeducation for Schizophrenia, Schizophrenia is a chronic persistent and disabling psychiatric syndrome whose primary feature is the presence of delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech or behavior, catatonic behavior and negative symptoms (poverty of thought, social isolation, decreased expression of emotions and motivation for activities). Its incidence in one year is 15.9 per 100,000 inhabitants; its prevalence is 4.3 per 1,000 inhabitants and has been shown to be more common among men, migrant population, urban area, developed countries and greater latitude. It is associated with: 1) Increased mortality rates compared to the general population 2) Disability is one of the top ten causes of years lived with disability in people between 15 and 44 years old, which can be explained by incomplete remission of up to 80% of affected patients and psychotic relapses (5-7). 3) High economic costs given by relapses, hospitalizations, decreased labor productivity and financial and emotional burden for families (8,9). The latter has increased in the last 50 years by changes in the mental health care systems throughout the world that have left families a greater responsibility in caring for patients so they would need more knowledge about the disorder, treatment and rehabilitation (10,11). All this justifies the search for strategies aimed at preventing psychosis crisis increase the period between crises and decrease disability (12,13,14). Psychoeducation is one of the strategies that have been raised so far (15).||Psychoeducation is an intervention based on the structured and systematic knowledge acquisition of a mental disorder, with the aim of improving their clinical prognosis and reduce care costs (15,16,17). There are various designs of psychoeducative programs, they can be individual or group, involving only patients, family or both, or short (less than 10 sessions) or longer. There is insufficient evidence to establish whether any of these methods is most effective, and with respect to the psychoeducation in general, available studies suggest that it may have beneficial effect on reduction in relapses, adherence, hospital stay, global functioning and quality of life (19). However, these studies have methodological limitations such as lack of clarity in the generation and concealment of randomized allocation sequence, non-blind assessment of outcomes and frequent losses in monitoring, suggesting that the effects observed for psychoeducation may not be valid and could be overestimated. Additionally, the cultural characteristics and health system of each country may limit the applicability of studies, which may be necessary to evaluate the efficacy in sites with particular conditions (20).||In a private psychiatric clinic in Medellin primarily serving patients who belong to the contributory scheme of health care, Brief Psychoeducation Group Program was designed (five sessions) for Patients with Schizophrenia and their Families (PGSF). It was decided to include both patients and relatives because some studies suggest there may be advantages and generally patients with this disorder should go out accompanied. It will be group because some authors have argued that it could have more benefits than individual, to facilitate meetings with others, by facilitating the encounter with other people with similar conditions, which could have additional therapeutic effects and be more cost-effective (19). It will be five sessions because it was considered that they could cover the main issues and ensure the attendance at all sessions, taking into account the economic conditions and time restrictions most for most relatives. It is very important to evaluate the effectiveness of this program because that will allow making informed decisions regarding the implementation in this and other psychiatric care institutions in the country. In addition, there are not any controlled clinical trials in Colombia that evaluate the effectiveness of a psychoeducational intervention for this disorder.||Therefore, the research question is: In a psychiatric clinic of Medellin (Colombia), What is the effectiveness of a Brief Psychoeducational Group Program for Patients with Schizophrenia and their Families (PGSF) added to their Outpatient Treatment as Usual (TAU) compared with TAU to reduce the risk of relapse?, Schizophrenia|Patient Education
1	Improving Working Memory of Children With Autism, Prescreening:||The purpose of prescreening is to determine the IQ and functioning level of the participants. The investigators will administrate IQ tests in which the participants will complete a series of tasks such as pointing to images/objects, placing objects, and answer questions upon instruction. The investigators will interview parents regarding their children's levels of functioning as well as their information (e.g., level of education). Additionally, the investigators will also assess the number of digits (digit span) and delay for each participant as the participants may function at different levels. Members of the research team will test a combination of different digit span and delays for each participant to assess how many digits in a sequence (i.e., digit span) they can remember and how long (i.e., delay) they can remember the digit sequence.||Pretest:||A pretest trial starts when a teacher asks a participant to repeat a sequence of numbers and a sequence of nonsense words. The teacher will say one number or one nonsense word at a time, wait for a predetermined interval, and ask the participant to report the numbers or the words in the exact sequence as they hear. The trial ends after the participant recalls correctly or incorrectly, or if the participant does not produce a recall after 5 s. The teacher will not provide any verbal feedback for participants' responses during the pretest. The investigators will conduct pretest for approximately one week. During the pretest, teacher will record exactly what the participant says.||Random assignment:||After pretest, the participants will be randomly assigned to one of four groups: control, rehearsal, reinforcement, and rehearsal + reinforcement groups.||Control group Participants in this group will not receive any intervention during the study.||Rehearsal group Participants in this group will receive rehearsal intervention. The intervention will last approximately 2-3 weeks depending on the participant performance. Sessions will be conducted daily, and each will include 10 trials.||A preference assessment will be conducted to determine the reinforcer before each session. Participants will be asked to choose a reinforcer that they would like to receive during the instruction. In a rehearsal trial, the teacher will verbally present numbers in a sequence. After a number is verbally presented, the teacher will prompt the participant to rehearse (repeat) the number being said as well as all previous numbers. Correct rehearsal will be followed by a reinforcer (e.g., an edible item with verbal praise). Once the participant can independently rehearse the number(s), the prompts for verbal rehearsal will only be provided when he or she does not start providing a rehearsal within 1 s. The reinforcer will then only be given for correct unprompted verbal rehearsal. If the participant does not provide any verbal rehearsals or verbalize incorrect numbers, the instructor will repeat the process and ask the participant to rehearse the numbers again. After the predetermined delay after the correct verbal rehearsal, the participant will be asked to recall the number sequence. No reinforcement or feedback will be provided.||Reinforcement group A preference assessment will be conducted to determine the reinforcer before each session. Participants will be asked to choose a reinforcer that they would like to receive during the instruction. Before each trial, the teacher will verbally instruct the participant to try to remember the numbers and that the reinforcer will be delivered upon the correct recall. In each trial, the teacher will verbally present numbers in a sequence. After a while, the teacher will ask the participant to repeat the numbers in the sequence. If the participant correctly repeats the numbers, the reinforcer will be given. If the numbers are repeated incorrectly, the reinforcement will not be given. No other instruction will be given (e.g., on rehearsal strategy).||Rehearsal + reinforcement group The participants in this group will receive rehearsal intervention and reinforcement in the same manner as the participants in the rehearsal group as well as in the reinforcement group.||Posttest:||Posttest procedure and data collection will be the same as those during pretest., 0

All patients will enter a run-in period to receive a stable therapeutic dose of oral risperidone immediate-release for at least 4 weeks. After the 4-week run-in period, patients will be randomly assigned to either remain on oral risperidone immediate-release (IR) or to receive a therapeutic dose of oral paliperidone extended-release (ER) and patients will be prospectively followed for a 24-week treatment phase. The treatment phase is composed of a 4-week flexible dose period followed by a 20-week stable dose period. During the 4-week flexible dose period, the dose of paliperidone ER or risperidone IR may be increased or decreased for each patient if clinically indicated (eg, significant side effects emerge or there is evidence of a lack of efficacy). At the end of 4-week flexible dose period, the final dose should be maintained for the 20-week fixed-dose period.

0	A Pragmatic Trial of Brief CBT for Anxiety in VA Primary Care, This 4-year, multisite trial (Houston, New Orleans and San Antonio) will use a pragmatic randomized trial design to examine the effectiveness and implementation potential of a brief cognitive behavioral therapy(bCBT) intervention for anxiety delivered either in-person or via VA Video Connect-Home (VVC-H), according to patient preference. Brief CBT will be delivered by existing Primary Care Mental Health Integration (PCMHI) providers at three large VAMCs (Houston, New Orleans, and San Antonio). Aim 1 will examine the clinical effectiveness of the bCBT intervention vs. Enhanced Usual Care (EUC) for anxiety at 4-, 8-, and 12-month follow-ups. Aim 2 will determine factors associated with bCBT response and explore Veteran demographic and clinical factors associated with VVC-H engagement. An exploratory aim will use mixed, qualitative and quantitative methods to better understand implementation successes and challenges related to delivery and impact of bCBT anxiety and VVC-H use in the PCMHI setting. The primary hypothesis is that anxiety outcomes, as measured by the General Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7) will be superior at 4-, 8-, and 12-month follow up for patients who are assigned to receive bCBT vs. EUC.||In addition, participants will be asked to complete the Diversity Supplement measures and qualitative interview to evaluate whether sociocultural factors are associated with the severity and type of anxiety symptoms among Veterans of different race/ethnicity groups., anxiety disorder|panic disorder|phobia, social|worry|stress
