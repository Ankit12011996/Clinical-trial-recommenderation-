2	"An Open-label Study Evaluating the Maintenance of Clinical Effect in Adult Schizophrenia Patients Switched From Risperidone Tablets to an Equivalent Dose of a Rapidly-dissolving Tablet Formulation of Risperdone, This trial is a non-randomized, open-label, single arm, multicentre study aimed at evaluating the maintenance of clinical effect of the rapidly-dissolving tablet dosage form of risperidone, in patients switched from their previous equivalent dose of conventional risperidone tablets (doses of 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg, 3 mg or 4 mg/day). Approximately 100 adult schizophrenia patients (ages >= 18 years) who are symptomatically stable will be enrolled. Patients will be asked to take an equivalent dose of the rapidly-dissolving tablet form of risperidone for 4 weeks of treatment. Other psychotropic medications taken at study entry may be continued throughout the study, providing the dose was stable prior to entry for a minimum of 4 weeks and will remain stable throughout the course of the study. Dose escalation/reduction of rapidly-dissolving risperidone tablets is not permitted. Study visits will take place twice over the 4 week period, once at study entry and again at the final visit. The primary efficacy parameter will be the CGI-Severity (CGI-S) score for maintenance of clinical effect. Secondarily, two 5-point Likert scales will be completed, one measuring clinician's assessment of anxiety symptoms and the other measuring clinician's assessment of depressive symptoms. Patients with existing symptoms of psychosis will be clinician rated on a 5-point Likert scale. Other secondary assessments include: Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for risperidone acceptability, completed by the patient or the caregiver (if applicable). For each subject, the VAS score will be calculated on a 10 cm line ranging from a score of ""0"" (not acceptable) to ""10"" (very acceptable). Safety evaluations during the study will include vital signs and physical examination, body weight, adverse event surveillance, and urine pregnancy tests for females of childbearing potential. The study hypothesis is that the clinical effect will be maintained when schizophrenia patients previously stabilized on risperidone conventional tablets are treated with rapidly-dissolving risperidone tablets, and that risperidone rapidly dissolving tablets will be well tolerated.||Subjects who are stable on conventional risperidone tablets (0.5, 1, 2, 3 or 4 mg/day) for at least 2 weeks will be switched to an equivalent dose of rapidly-dissolving risperidone tablets (0.5, 1, 2, 3 or 4 mg/day). The study medication will be taken orally for 4 weeks, using the same frequency of dosing (once-daily, twice-daily, etc.) as with their previous conventional tablet regimen., risperidone|schizophrenia|rapidly-dissolving"
2	Predictors of Persistence in Patients With Schizophrenia Treated With Once-monthly Aripiprazole in Spain, This is an observational, retrospective, non-interventional study that will include schizophrenic patients who were initiated on AOM treatment during an schizophrenia-related hospitalisation at least 6 months before data collection and in a real clinical practice setting.||Data from each patient will be collected after informed consent is obtained (if possible), and will include retrospective information mainly from the index date (start of AOM treatment, baseline timepoint) until the last information available in the patient file at the time of data collection (minimum of 6 months after the index date). Data will be retrospectively collected from all visits occurring as per clinical practice (usually once-monthly)., long-acting injectable antipsychotic|persistence

2	L-Theanine in the Management of Schizophrenia, This is a two-year randomized placebo-controlled double-blind investigation of the use of augmentative L-theanine in the management of 60 patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorders. We will investigate several outcome variables in these patients including the positive and negative symptoms, affective features, emotional distress, neuropsychological testing, side effects, and the quality of life. Participating subjects on stable antipsychotic treatment will be randomized to receive for 8 weeks either L-theanine (400 mg/day) or a placebo in addition to regular ongoing antipsychotic medication for 8 weeks. Subjects will be assessed at baseline and after 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks of treatment using psychiatric rating scales, self-reported questionnaires, and a neuropsychological battery of tests. The efficacy and safety of augmenting antipsychotic treatment with L-theanine will be analyzed.||The Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) will be administered at commencement and completion of the study. The CANTAB battery consists of a series of interrelated computerized tests of visual and movement skills, attention and memory, and executive function, administered via a touch sensitive screen. The nonverbal nature of the CANTAB tests makes them largely language independent and culture free. These tests are run on an IBM-compatible personal computer with a touch-sensitive screen. Neuropsychological testing lasts approximately 2 hours. Subjects complete the tests in a fixed order with a break half-way through the testing session. For a description of the nature of these tests, the performance measures used, and how the test scores are derived, see (http://www.cantab.com/cantab/site/home.acds). The neuropsychological tests are categorized onto five cognitive domains: visual and movement skills, attention, memory, learning, sustained attention, and executive function: Motor Screening, Big/Little Circle, Reaction Time, Matching to Sample Visual Search, Delayed Matching to Sample, Pattern Recognition Memory, Spatial Recognition Memory, Spatial Span, Rapid visual information processing, Spatial working memory, Intra/Extra Dimensional Set Shift, and Stockings of Cambridge. In addition to raw scores from these tasks, the average value of the z-scores of the CANTAB neurocognitive tasks will be used to determine cognitive indices in specific domains., Schizophrenia|Schizoaffective disorders|Theonine|Augmentation
2	Pregnenolone in the Management of Schizophrenia Patients, Either pregnenolone (30 mg/d or 200 mg/d), DHEA (400 mg/d)or placebo will be added to regular treatment for 8 weeks. Subjects will be assessed at baseline and after 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks of treatment. An extensive battery of research instruments will be used for assessment of the following domains of interest: psychopathology, insight, side effects, and cognitive functions. Plasma pregnenolone, DHEA(S), cortisol and other relevant steroids will be assayed at baseline, 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks of treatment. Efficacy and safety of augmentation of antipsychotic treatment with pregnenolone will be analyzed., Schizophrenia|Pregnenolone|Neurosteroids

2	NRX-1074 in Early Course Schizophrenia, Investigators propose to conduct a 4-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which NRX-1074 will be intravenously administered twice. Subjects will be 62 stable patients ages 18-50 within five years of onset of schizophrenia, treated with any antipsychotic except clozapine at an adequate, stable dose for at least 8 weeks. This study will be conducted by the Schizophrenia Program of the NYU Langone Medical Center and at the Psychiatry Outpatient Clinic of Bellevue Hospital located in New York, NY.||Upon signing consent, patients will undergo screening procedures to assess eligibility. A diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder will be determined by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM IV (SCID) completed by a research clinician using all available clinical data and will be confirmed by consensus diagnosis. A comprehensive medical review and physical exam, including routine laboratory tests, will be completed to identify unstable medical illness. A urine toxicology screen and, in females, a pregnancy test will also be performed. A research assistant will complete the Logical Memory Test portion of the Weschler Memory Scale-III (WMS-III).||Subjects who meet study eligibility criteria will complete the baseline visit which will include a one minute infusion of NRX-1074 and the following clinical assessments: Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms (CAINS), Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS), InterSePT Scale for Suicidal Thinking (ISST), Clinical Global Impression (CGI), and Systematic Assessment for Treatment Emergent Events (SAFTEE). The BPRS, SAFTEE, and ISST will be conducted twice, both before and after the infusion. The remaining assessments will be conducted before the infusion. A cognitive assessment, the Logical Memory Test of the WMS-III, will also be conducted after the infusion.||Patients will return for a visit one day after their baseline infusion, where the BPRS, ISST, CGI, and Logical Memory Test will be conducted. Their next visit will be one week later, where they receive their second NRX-1074 infusion, and will be similar in format to the first baseline infusion with the exception of CAINS and CDSS. One day after the second infusion, patients will be administered the BPRS, CAINS, CDSS, ISST, CGI, and MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB). Patients will then return weekly for three weeks until Day 28.||The BPRS and ISST will be conducted during the Baseline, Day 1, Day 7, Day 8, Day 14, Day 21, and Day 28 visits. The CGI will be administered during Baseline, Day 1, Day 7, Day 8, Day 14, and Day 28. The CAINS and CDSS will be administered at Baseline, Day 8, Day 14, and Day 28. The SAFTEE will be conducted on Baseline, Day 7, Day 14, Day 21, and Day 28. The Logical Memory Test will be administered during Screening Visit 1, Screening Visit 2, Baseline, and Day 1. The MATRICS will be conducted on Day 8 and Day 28.||The primary outcome measure is the change in BPRS total score from Baseline to 24 hours post infusion on Day 8. Secondary outcome measures include the positive and negative symptom subscales on the BPRS, the CAINS total score, the composite score on the MATRICS 24 hours after the second infusion and the Logical Memory Test compared to placebo one hour after the first infusion (Baseline)., Schizophrenia|Naurex|Intravenous Treatment|NRX-1074

2	Treatment for First-Episode Schizophrenia, The goal of the study is to prevent morbidity in first-episode schizophrenia using second-generation antipsychotic drugs: olanzapine, risperidone.||Long-term studies of first-episode schizophrenia patients have clearly indicated excellent initial responsiveness of positive psychotic symptoms to treatment with conventional antipsychotic medications. However, in the years immediately following this initial good response, morbidity increases. Relapses, often multiple ones, are the rule and are usually precipitated by medication noncompliance. There is some evidence that the second-generation antipsychotic drugs may have superior efficacy in terms of these outcome domains. However, these newer agents have been studied primarily in chronic and/or treatment-resistant patient samples and there are virtually no long-term studies or studies comparing the new drugs with one another.||First episode patients are randomly assigned to treatment with olanzapine or risperidone for 3 years. Outcome measures for the initial episode include psychopathology (positive, negative, and affective symptoms), side effects, neurocognition (executive function, memory, and attention), social and occupational function and service utilization. The effects on long-term course are measured in terms of frequency and timing of relapses, level of recovery from subsequent episodes and prospectively assessed course of psychopathology, neurocognitive function, social/vocational function, and service utilization.||For information on a related study, please follow this link:||http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00320671, Adolescence|Adult|Antipsychotic Agents|Female|Human|Male|olanzapine|Risperidone|Schizophrenia|Antipsychotic Agents -- *therapeutic use|olanzapine -- *therapeutic use|Risperidone -- *therapeutic use|Schizophrenia -- *drug therapy
1	Parent-delivered Massage for Children With Autism - Ages 6 to 11, Children will be randomly divided into treatment groups and wait-list control groups. The control groups begin treatment five months after the treatment groups begin.||All children will be tested on three occasions in the first year: prior to beginning treatment, and five and twelve months later. Results will be shared with parents at the end of each year. Testers will remain blinded as to which group is currently receiving treatment.||There is no cost to parents for participation in this research study. Families meeting the eligibility criteria will be accepted into the study on a first-come, first-served basis., Massage|effectiveness|autism|parent stress
2	Social Cognitive Assessment in Autism and Schizophrenia, The project's objectives are: (1) to assess relevance of ClaCoS in schizophrenia and autism compared to healthy controls, and to analyze links between social cognition and both neurocognition and symptoms, (2) to collect data in a large sample of healthy controls in order to establish appropriate standards for tools composing ClaCoS battery.||For the first objective, three kind of evaluation will be proposed: clinical, neurocognitive and social cognitive (ClaCoS). Three populations of 80 participants will be compared: healthy controls, patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorders, and patients with autism spectrum disorders. These three groups will be matched on sex, age and level of education.||For the second objective a systematic collection of data will be carried out in a large sample of healthy controls. In this part of the study, only social cognitive measures will be recorded. Subjects will be ranked according to three criteria: three classes for age (18-25 years old, 26-35 and 36-45), five classes for socio-professional status according to the INSEE classification, and two classes for sex (men/women)., schizophrenia
2	A Clinical Study That Will Assess the Effect of SEP-363856 and Prior Antipsychotic (PA) Standard of Care on Glucose and Regulation of Insulin in Patients With Schizophrenia, This is an open-label, fixed sequence, multiple dose design. Following screening evaluations, subjects will check-in to the clinical research unit. After confirmation of continuation criteria, subjects will undergo an oral glucose tolerance test (oGTT), mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT) and spirulina breath test (GEBT). After these assessments are completed, subjects will have their prior antipsychotic (PA) or any other medication with psychotropic propensity washed out (dependent on their antipsychotic elimination half-life).||Subjects will undergo SEP-363856 titration schedule, followed by the oGTT, MMTT and GEBT tests during the SEP-363856 Stable Dose Period.||Subjects will be stabilized on their prior antipsychotic, discharged from the clinical research unit, and return to the unit for the follow-up visit 7 + 2 days after discharge., schizophrenia
2	50 Hz vs. 25 Hz Magnetic Seizure Therapy for Schizophrenia, Magnetic seizure therapy (MST) is likely to be an alternative options to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).Widespread stimulation of cortical and subcortical regions is inevitable for ECT since the substantial impedance of the scalp and skull shuts most of the electrical stimulus away from the brain. Nevertheless, magnetic pulses are capable to focus the stimulus to a specific area of the brain because they can pass the scalp and skull without resistance. In Addition, electric current will penetrate into deeper structures, while magnetic stimulus are only capable to reach a depth of a few centimeters. As a consequence, MST are able to generate focus stimuli on superficial regions of the cortex while ECT can't, which may give MST the capability to produce comparable therapeutic benefits with the absence of apparent cognitive side effects. Though high dose (frequency) MST is gaining popularity, there is no evidences supporting its superiority over low dose (frequency) MST either on efficacy, safety, or seizure quality., magnetic seizure therapy|schizophrenia|controlled trial|cognition
2	Randomized Clinical Trial of Intensive Computer-based Cognitive Remediation in Recent-onset Schizophrenia, Participation in this study will last approximately 12 months and will involve individuals with recent-onset schizophrenia. All participants will undergo baseline assessments that will include an interview, written tests, blood draws, and electroencephalogram (EEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Participants will then be assigned randomly to receive treatment with either computerized neuroadaptive cognitive training or commercially available computer games. Participants will be asked to complete 60-minute sessions of their assigned treatments 5 days per week for 8 weeks. For participants receiving cognitive training, exercises will focus on improving speed and accuracy in the perception of and response to verbal and visuospatial targets. The 8 weeks of treatment will focus on targeted cognitive training (TCT). Participants assigned to practice computer games will play standard commercially available games, with no targeted response.||Participants will repeat baseline assessments after the computer training and Month 6 of follow-up. The EEG and MRI will be repeated only at post training assessment visit. There will be a blood draw at Week 2 of treatment as well. After the Month 6 assessment, participants in the control condition will be offered an opportunity to complete an additional 8 weeks of computer training with different modules., Psychosis|First Episode|Schizophrenia|Cognitive Remediation
2	Observational Study in Patients With Schizophrenia Treated With Long-Acting Risperidone Injection (RISPERDAL CONSTA), This is a 2-year, prospective (a study in which the patients are identified and then followed forward in time for the outcome of the study), multi-center (at multiple sites), longitudinal (study that involves repeated observations of the same outcomes in the same people over long periods of time), observational study (study in which the investigators/ physicians observe the patients and measure their outcomes) in adults with schizophrenia (mental disorder characterized by a breakdown of thought processes and by poor emotional responsiveness). Physicians will determine the appropriate treatment for their patients, according to their usual practice. Patients starting treatment with long-acting risperidone injection (an antipsychotic medication) and meeting all the study criteria will be enrolled in the study. They will receive a dose of 25, 37.5 or 50 mg of risperidone every 2 weeks by intramuscular injection, and continue their treatment for schizophrenia according to usual care by their physicians. Patients will be asked questions at baseline and every three months for a period of two years to assess: efficacy of the medication, how well the patient is functioning, use of healthcare resources (eg, emergency room visits and hospitalizations) patient work status, quality of life and patient satisfaction with the medicine. Safety will be monitored throughout the study duration of 2 years., Schizophrenia|Mental disorder|DSM-IV|RISPERDAL CONSTA|Risperidone|Long-acting risperidone|Disorganized|Catatonic|Paranoid

0	"Happy Mother - Healthy Baby: Supplement Study on Biological Processes Underlying Anxiety During Pregnancy, This study will leverage the ongoing randomized evaluation of the CBT anxiety prevention intervention in Pakistan (R01-MH111859) to explore potential biological mechanisms. This CBT intervention targets both sub-threshold anxiety symptoms and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in early- to mid- pregnancy, aiming to both prevent and treat Common Mental Disorders (CMDs) (GAD and major depressive episodes (MDE)) as well as improve birth outcomes. The study team proposes to additionally study biological correlates of antenatal anxiety (i.e., immune and endocrine functioning) in 300 women: in addition to 200 drawn from our randomized trial (100 intervention, 100 usual care), the study will also include 100 healthy women without anxiety or depression. The aims are to 1) characterize the ""immune phenotype"" of anxious women across the peripartum, specifically by measuring the relation among anxiety symptoms and peripheral markers of inflammation within and across women (both anxious and healthy) and between those receiving the intervention and control; 2) determine the relation between levels of allopregnanolone (ALLO) in pregnancy and concurrent anxiety symptoms and future symptoms of postpartum depression (PPD), 3) examine the relation between changes in immune functioning and ALLO levels in anxious pregnancy across time, 4) examine whether immune function and/or ALLO are mediators or moderators of the association between antenatal anxiety and preterm birth and/or small-for-gestational age, and 5) examine the effects of both anxiety and the intervention (including biomarkers) on infant development at six weeks postpartum., randomized controlled trial|inflammation|hormones"
0	Common Engagement Strategies (Common Factors) for Childhood Anxiety, Children who are thought to have mild to moderate anxiety will, via their parents, be offered the opportunity to receive treatment from their pediatric primary care provider. Providers will either use their existing anxiety approaches or will use those approaches combined with extra communication skills designed to promote patient and parent engagement in care. Children will be seen for up to 4 30-minute visits at 2 week intervals, with a follow-up telephone call 3 months later to asses the impact of treatment. Children with more severe anxiety (or those whose parents so desire) will be referred for specialized mental health care., 0
2	Aripiprazole IM Depot in the Acute Treatment of Adults With Schizophrenia, Screening Phase: The screening phase will begin when informed consent is signed and be a maximum of 13 days. The investigators will assess the subjects who meet all eligibility criteria and collect the characteristic information of the subjects, such as demographic, medical history, etc. If subjects have been exposed to aripiprazole in the past (ie, tolerability has been established), then subjects will enter a washout period for 3～7 days from prior antipsychotic medications and other prohibited concomitant medications. If the investigator may reasonably verify that subject has been off antipsychotics for at least 3～7 days and has a history of tolerating aripiprazole, then the subject may have a screening phase of < 7 days as long as the subject has had at least a 3～7-day washout phase from other antipsychotic medications. Subjects are required to be hospitalized during the entire screening phase.||12-week Acute Treatment Phase: At baseline, eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either aripiprazole IM depot or aripiprazole tablet. For 14 days beginning with the first injection, subjects randomized aripiprazole IM depot will receive concomitant oral aripiprazole and subjects randomized to aripiprazole tablet will receive 12 weeks concomitant injection placebo.||Safety Follow-up Phase: All subjects will be followed-up for safety via telephone contact 14(±2) days after the last trial visit., Schizophrenia|Aripiprazole Intramuscular Depot|Acute treatment

2	Music Therapy Towards Schizophrenia, Negative Symptoms, Schizophrenia includes 1 % of the Population in Denmark (DK) and often ends up to be chronically. Negative Symptoms are difficult to reduce by Medication and Psychosocial Treatment Possibilities are searched for. Three Cochrane Reviews (2005, 2011, 2017) have been conducted concerning Music Therapy and Schizophrenia with Positive Results. This RCT, double-blinded Study aims at verifying, if these Results can be Recognized in the Danish Health System. It also aims at being similar to Biomedical Study Designs as much as possible to strengthen the Evidence of the Study. A Power Calculation showed, that a minimum of 44,5 Participants in each Arm should be available, but as drop out can be anticipated with this Population, 60 Participants in each Arm were recommended. The screening Procedure is Comprehensive as it aims at securing, that the negative Symptoms are part of the Illness Schizophrenia and not side Effects from Medication or simultaneous Depression (See the Inclusion- and Exclusion criteria).||The Measurement Tools are as follows:||At Baseline, after 15 Sessions and at Termination:||The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS),|Brief Negative Symptom Scale (BNSS),|Quality of Life (WHOQOL-Bref),|Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS),|Board of Clinical Examinations (Danish Questionnaire) (UKU)|Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (GAF) 4 Weeks after Termination Follow Up Interview.

1	Long-Term Olanzapine Treatment in Children With Autism, Autism is a serious childhood disorder that can significantly impair functioning and development. Educational and psychosocial programs are standard treatments for autistic children, but drug therapy is often needed as well. Haloperidol is the drug most commonly prescribed for symptoms of autism. However, long-term administration of haloperidol has been associated with adverse effects such as blurred vision, constipation, and nausea. The investigation of alternative drug treatments is necessary. This study will determine whether the antipsychotic drug olanzapine may be a safe and effective alternative to haloperidol for treating symptoms of autism in children.||This study will last 36 weeks and will comprise 2 phases. In Phase I, participants will be randomly assigned to receive either olanzapine or placebo for 12 weeks. Participants who do not respond to treatment will complete their participation in the study. Participants who respond to their assigned Phase I treatment will continue onto Phase II. All Phase II participants will receive olanzapine daily for 6 months. Self-report scales and checklists will be used to assess participants after each phase; these measures will be completed by participants and their parents., Drug Treatment|Child|Olanzapine

2	Study With Information Technology (IT) - Aided Preventive Program in Schizophrenia, Title of Study:||ITAREPS Trial: A Prospective Randomized Double-blind Controlled Study in IT-aided Mobile Phone-based Relapse Prevention Program in Schizophrenia.||Estimated Number of Study Centers and Countries:||30-40 outpatient psychiatrists in the Czech Republic and in the Slovak Republic.||Research Hypothesis:||Information Technology-aided Program of Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia (ITAREPS) will decrease the number of hospitalizations in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who are treated in the outpatient psychiatric setting, as evidenced by the reduction of the total number of hospitalizations due to relapse of psychosis at the end of the 12-months follow-up period in the active ITAREPS group compared to the control (treatment-as-usual) group.||Study Phase:||Non Drug Interventional Study||Study Objective:||To evaluate effectiveness of the ITAREPS program in reduction of the number of hospitalizations due to relapse of psychosis. The ITAREPS program employs mobile phone communication between the psychiatrist and the patient. Subjects enrolled in the project (patient and his/her family member) are instructed to complete two separate versions of the 10-item Early Warning Signs Questionnaire (EWSQ) upon a weekly SMS request sent automatically by the system. EWSQ detects proportional worsening (or a new onset) of psychotic symptoms compared to the last week's score of the completed questionnaire. Individual EWSQ scores are sent by the subjects back to the ITAREPS system as a SMS text message. If the EWSQ score exceeds given score thresholds, an immediate ALERT requesting a therapeutic intervention is announced to the investigator as an e-mail message and a timely pharmacological intervention is triggered in accordance with the Early Intervention Algorithm (EIA).||Study design:||This is an international, randomized, double-blind, controlled, design-blinded, non drug, interventional study. Subjects (patient and family member pairs) will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio into the interventional or control group. All subjects will complete the EWSQ on a weekly basis. In the interventional group, e-mail alert message feedback to the investigator will be active and the investigator will react by using the EIA. In the control (treatment-as-usual) group, alerts will not be generated and the investigator will detect and react on the potential signs of the psychotic relapse only by using the standard clinical approach. The ALERTs will be reported to the investigators in approximately 50% of all ALERT events but the investigators and subjects will be kept blinded about the real study design - parallel or (multiple) cross-over.

An interim analysis evaluating the between group differences in the number of psychiatric hospitalization days will be performed after all enrolled patients have completed their Visit 2 (month 6)., prevention|relapse|schizophrenia
2	Risk Prediction Model of Cardiovascular Events in Patients With Schizophrenia, Schizophrenia is a common severe mental disorder with high rate of disability, which seriously affects patients' life.It is necessary to take long-term therapy to control symptoms or prevent recurrence. Studies have found that schizophrenia patients live on average ten to twenty-five years less than others. The main reason for high rates of mortality and disability is the high risk of cardiovascular events.There are few domestic large-scale studys on the risk of cardiovascular events in schizophrenia, thus they have not formed objective tools to assess cardiovascular risk. If this risk can be objectively assessed and predicted at an early stage, it is expected to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events and thus reduce mortality.At present, there are mature tools for assessing the risk of cardiovascular events in patients, such as Framingham, PRIMROSE, etc.The latter is the new tool for assessing cardiovascular events in patients with severe mental disorders. This study used a retrospective cohort design to collect the history of hospitalized schizophrenia patients within 2 years, collect relevant informations about cardiovascular events. The investigators validate the PRIMROSE model in China and explore the risk prediction model of cardiovascular events in schizophrenia patients., 0

1	Android Mobile Devices to Assist Routine Anticipation for Autistic Children, Autism is a disorder characterized by social deficits, and among others by changes in communication. The diagnosis of this disorder remains accomplished by direct assessment the individual's behavior, according to specific clinical criteria present the classification systems of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV). Therapists teach autistic to communicate with the help of symbols and auxiliary anticipation and communication routines, usually using the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS), or photos. However these are presented in transition PECS cards and do not follow the children in activities that develop outside the school environment. The objective of this work is to develop an application to run on a mobile device Android tablet that features the visual routines.||In this way the routines can be accessed outside the school environment. This technology is easy to use and facilitates data entry by touching the screen, was developed using the Unified Modeling Language (UML), Javascript, Apache Web server and Web browser Chrome. The application validation, will be held with 10 autistic and 2 teachers from the center of inclusion and support for autistic. Teachers should insert the activities programmed for each autistic student. Tablet in student performance in communicating with this tablet will be measured. Parents or guardians knowledge with the PECS system will be trained and will be evaluated on their autonomy inserting images, audio and subtitles. The application should aid communication, cause the autistic understand the sequence of events in daily life, decreasing their aggression because of not knowing what will be their next activity. Participation in this research poses no risk or harm the concerned person. If during the research participant decides not anymore have the freedom to do so without incurring any damage you. The technical validation proposal is necessary for it to be used by people with autism. If validated in a positive way, the technique could improve the quality of life of these people and their families., Autism

2	Will Decreased Noradrenergic Activity Normalize Information Processing in Patients With Schizophrenia?, A number of reports in literature provide evidence for, among others, an increased central noradrenergic activity in schizophrenia. In addition to this increased noradrenergic activity, patients with schizophrenia often show reduced filtering of sensory information, which is reflected in reduced P50 suppression and reduced prepulse inhibition of the startle reflex (PPI). In two separate initial studies in our laboratory, we found reduced sensory gating following administration of imipramine (a combined noradrenergic and serotonergic agonist) and desipramine (a highly specific noradrenergic agonist) to healthy volunteers. This provides evidence for a direct causal relation between the increased noradrenergic activity and the disturbed gating of sensory information, as both commonly found in patients with schizophrenia. Therefore, in a follow-up study, the effects of a noradrenergic antagonist will be investigated on the sensory gating of patients with schizophrenia. To further extend the data of our initial studies, the patients will additionally be tested for two psychophysiological parameters of attention that are usually found to be disturbed in patients with schizophrenia, i.e. mismatch negativity and selective attention. The design will conform to a double blind, placebo controlled experiment, in which either four doses (0.25 ug, 50 ug, 75 ug or 150 ug)of clonidine or placebo will be added to the current medical treatment of 20 male patients with schizophrenia on five occasions, separated by at least a week, after which they are tested in the Copenhagen Psychophysiological Test Battery (CPTB).In order to test the effects of clonidine in healthy volunteers, 20 healthy males will receive a fixed dose of 0.15 mg clonidine or placebo on two separate occasions separated by at least a week, after which they will be tested in the CPTB as well., Schizophrenia|Information processing|PPI|P50 gating|P300|mismatch negativity|clonidine

0	"The Effects of Dog Intervention on Anxiety Levels in Children Undergoing an MRI Examination, MRI is an imaging method common worldwide, both for adults and children. Studies show, however, that about two thirds of the children undergoing MRI suffer from feelings of anxiety ranging from mild apprehension to severe distress. For very young children, the unfamiliar surroundings, new faces, strange equipment and particularly the noise generated during the scan, can all cause feelings of stress and anxiety so severe that the test either cannot even begin or cannot be performed properly because the child is incapable of lying still. For older children and adults claustrophobia is the main reason of poor image quality because of motion artifacts or early termination of the scan.||Anxiety is a reaction to an unfamiliar situation and its strength is far greater than the objective danger. Anxiety is characterized by subjective feelings of stress and worry that activate the autonomic nervous system.||In recent years, more and more use is made of certain techniques to prepare patients for a wide range of treatments, including methods of preparing patients for the MRI procedure, especially children. The purpose of preparation is to familiarize patients with the equipment and the stages of the imaging procedure. It also enables the technician to answer questions the patient may have and thereby avoid false assumptions about the procedure.||Intervention with animals, dogs in particular, is developing around the world and is being used in a variety of activities in rehabilitation centers, nursing homes, special education schools, hospitals and more.||In 1987 the National Institutes of Health (NIH) recognized the field of animal therapy and during the last two decades many reports have been published on the positive effects when patients interact with animals. These reports include: performance improvements, improved physiological measurements, reduction of stress and anxiety, reduced feelings of loneliness and depression, and a more speedy recovery.The animal is seen as a ""friend"" in the strange world of the clinic. Having a companion dog present distracts the patient from the surroundings and procedures.||In a pilot study, conducted in 2001 at the New Jersey hospital, an intervention program with a dog was introduced for reducing anxiety in adults before an MRI. This study has demonstrated that animal-assisted intervention indeed decreases the anxiety levels of patients in a pre MRI setting.||Several studies have demonstrated the potential calming effects of companion animals on children but, to date, no formal studies on the relationship between dog intervention and a child's anxiety before an MRI procedure have been reported. The current study is designed to determine if dog intervention lessens children's anxiety prior to MRI., Anxiety|Dog Intervention|MRI|Children"
1	"Aripiprazole in Children With Autism: A Pilot Study, I. SPECIFIC AIM||To obtain pilot data regarding the safety, dosing, and efficacy of open-labeled aripiprazole in children, aged 12 to 18 years, diagnosed with autism. A larger, more controlled trial will be planned for this population if the drug is safe and tends to be efficacious.||II. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE||Autism is a serious disorder that first presents in childhood, usually before three years of age (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). Though the incidence of autism is low (approximately 3-6 cases per 10,000 live births), the consequences of the disorder are severe. As the term ""pervasive"" implies, the symptoms affect most areas of functioning in the developing child, and the disabilities associated with the disorder tend to persist throughout life. Symptoms of autism include abnormalities in social relatedness including extreme withdrawal; communication including no or little speech; and a sameness or repetitiveness in behaviors and interests. Children diagnosed with autism can have severe problems including hyperactivity, lability of mood, irritability, withdrawal, and stereotypical behavior. Because of these severe problems, treatment of symptomatology often includes pharmacotherapy.||The most studied drug for treating children and adolescents with autism is the typical neuroleptic, haloperidol (Anderson et al, 1989; Anderson et al, 1984; Campbell et al, 1978; and Cohen et al, 1980). The main public health concern regarding the use of haloperidol is the risk of inducing dyskinesias (Campbell et al, 1988, 1997), though the dyskinesias have been reversible.||Evidence also suggests that atypical neuroleptics, such as olanzapine (Horrigan et al, 1997b; Malone et al, 2001; Potenza et al, 1999) and risperidone (Demb, 1996; Findling et al, 1997; Fisman and Steele, 1996; Hardan et al, 1996; Horrigan et al, 1997a; Malone et al, 1999b; McDougle et al, 1997; Nicholson et al, 1998; Perry et al, 1997) are effective. But the weight gain associated with these agents can be a considerable health risk (Pi-Sunyer, 1993; Sjostrom, 1992). For example, olanzapine use has reportedly been associated with increased blood glucose (Fertig et al, 1998; Gatta et al, 1999; Ober et al, 1999; Wirshing et al, 1998; Yazici et al, 1998). Ziprasidone is associated with increases in QTc, including in children (Malone, unpublished data).||Aripiprazole, a recently released atypical agent is likely to be as effective as other neuroleptics in autism, but may have the considerable health advantage of not causing weight gain. However, because there is a lack of safety and efficacy data with aripiprazole in children with autism, an open pilot study of aripiprazole in this population is indicated.||III. DESIGN AND METHODS||A. Setting: The setting for this study will be the Specialty Clinic for Pervasive Developmental Disorders, part of the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Outpatient Clinic of Drexel University College of Medicine located at Friends Hospital.||B. Subjects: Subjects will be 15 children and adolescents who meet the DSM-IV Criteria for Pervasive Developmental Disorder.||C. Design: This is a 6-week pilot study employing open treatment with aripiprazole. Subjects will be rated at baseline and thereafter assessed weekly.||D. Medication: Subjects will be treated openly with aripiprazole. Should untoward effects occur, the dosage of the medication will be reduced or the medication will be discontinued, as clinically appropriate. Subjects will not receive other concomitant psychotropic medication during the study. Medication will be taken concomitant with food.||Aripiprazole Dosing Strategy: Aripiprazole tablets (10, 15, 20, and 30 mg) will be employed for the study. The dosage range for aripiprazole will be 5 mg/day to 30 mg/day. Every effort will be made to reach and maintain a therapeutic dosage by week four of the treatment phase.||For subjects who weigh less than 25 kg, starting dosage will be 5 mg/every other day. After 3 days, the dosage can be increased to 5 mg. By week 2, subjects can be increased up to 20 mg/day. Thereafter, dosage increases can be made in up to 10 mg increments weekly.|For subjects who weigh greater than 25 kg, the starting dosage will be 5 mg/day. After three days, the dosage can be increased to 10 mg/day. By week two, subjects can be increased to 20 mg/day. Thereafter, dosage increases can be made in up to 10 mg increments weekly as needed.||Note: Should 5 mg tablets not be available, the dosing schedule will employ ½ of a 10 mg tablet and dosage increases will be made in 10 mg increments. We are starting at a 5 mg dosage to avert excessive sedation at onset of drug administration.||F. Measures||Primary efficacy measure: The Clinical Global Impressions (CGI; Psychopharmacology Bulletin, 1985). The efficacy of treatments can be judged on their ability to enhance global functioning, an assessment that is particularly relative in a pilot study. The CGI consists of three global scales measuring severity of illness, global improvement, and drug effect, and has been useful in measuring drug treatment effect in this population (see Campbell and Palij, 1985). The PI and another trained rater will complete this scale. Although only members of the research team generally complete this scale, it will additionally be completed by the subject's parent/caretaker. Having it completed by the parent/caretaker will take only minutes and may result in useful data. This measure will be completed weekly beginning at baseline.|Secondary efficacy measure: Children's Psychiatric Rating Scale (Psychopharmacology Bulletin, 1985). The CPRS was developed by the Psychopharmacology Branch of the NIMH to rate childhood psychopathology. Each of the items is rated from ""1"" (not present) to ""7"" (extremely severe). The first 28 items of this scale require no verbal response on the part of the subject, making them appropriate for rating children and adolescents with Pervasive Developmental Disorder. Of these 28 items, 14 are particularly relevant in autism (see Campbell and Palij, 1985): they assess the symptoms for which drug treatment is indicated including hyperactivity, aggression, self-abusive behavior, temper tantrums, lability of mood, irritability, social withdrawal, and stereotypies. A composite sum of these 14 items, the CPRS-14, will be constructed and employed as a secondary outcome measure, a procedure used by a number of investigators (Anderson et al, 1989; Campbell et al, 1986, 1989, 1993; Findling et al, 1997; Sanchez et al, 1996). We analyzed our data using the CPRS-14; the ICC was 0.8978. In addition, 4 factors derived from these 14 items will be examined. They include: autism, anger/uncooperativeness, hyperactivity, and speech deviance (Overall and Campbell, 1988). This measure will be completed at baseline and at the end of treatment.|Safety measures: (1) A physical exam will be completed at baseline. (2) Height, weight, blood pressure, and pulse will be obtained and recorded at baseline and at each visit during the study. (3) The following laboratory measures will be obtained at baseline and repeated at the end of the treatment phase: complete blood count with differential, liver functions, and electrocardiogram. Serum prolactin will be obtained at baseline and at the end of the treatment phase. Any other clinically appropriate tests and evaluations will also be completed whenever needed.||Untoward effects will be measured and recorded at each visit employing the following measures: (1) Dosage Record and Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale (DOTES); (2) Treatment Emergent Symptoms Scale (TESS); (3) Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) (all from Psychopharmacology Bulletin, 1985); and (4) the Neurologic Rating Scale (Simpson and Angus, 1970). The DOTES and TESS measure a wide range of possible untoward effects. The AIMS measures dyskinesias. The Neurologic Rating Scale measures other forms of extrapyramidal effects that can occur with neuroleptics such as dystonias, parkinsonian effects, and akathisia.||G. Procedures: All patients appropriate to the study and their parent/caretakers will be approached and informed consent and assent (in subjects under 14 years) will be obtained. Subjects meeting the Inclusion Criteria, but not the Exclusion Criteria, will enter the baseline period of the study.||Baseline (week 0): Subjects will be rated at baseline employing the CGI and the CPRS.||End of Treatment (week 6): At the end of the treatment period, subjects will again be rated employing the CGI and the CPRS (selected items).||In addition, each subject will be rated on the CGI at each visit so that data from the last visit is available should the subject terminate the study prematurely. If it is known that a subject will terminate the study at a visit before week 6, the subject will be rated with the CGI and the CPRS at that visit.||All safety measures will be completed at each visit. Laboratory measures and EKG will be obtained in the morning.||H. Analysis: This is a pilot study whose purpose is to get initial safety and efficacy data with aripiprazole in children with autism. We will perform an ANOVA, repeated measures, for CGI severity scores, the CPRS-14 and the CPRS factors. Similar analyses will be performed for safety measures including for weight, prolactin and other laboratory measures, and EKG indices., Autism|Pervasive developmental disorder|Aripiprazole|Antipsychotic medication|Adolescents"

2	A Multi-Site Study of Strategies for Implementing Schizophrenia Guidelines, Background:||Schizophrenia, a chronic psychiatric disorder, is the second most frequent VA discharge diagnosis. Medication management practices for schizophrenia often are not guideline-concordant and place patients at risk for adverse outcomes. This project tests a new strategy to standard implementation for VHA Schizophrenia Guidelines.||Objectives:||Research objectives are: (1) to compare the effectiveness of a conceptually-based, enhanced intervention to that of a basic educational strategy with regard to improving guideline adherence and patient compliance; (2) to compare the effectiveness of the two strategies with regard to improving symptom and side effect outcomes; (3) to determine the effect of the enhanced intervention on service utilization for acute exacerbations of schizophrenia; (4) to determine the extent to which guideline-concordant medication management improves patient outcomes; and (5) to examine providers' knowledge of and attitudes toward guidelines.||Methods:||Thirteen VA sites were considered for the study, and VistA data were extracted to assess baseline guideline performance. Seven sites were selected and received basic education about schizophrenia guidelines. Three of these sites were randomly selected to receive the enhanced intervention, employing a nurse coordinator to promote providers' guideline adherence and patients' treatment adherence. Subjects with an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia were enrolled and were interviewed at baseline and six months using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, the Schizophrenia Outcomes Module, and the Barnes Akathisia Scale. Data on guideline adherence were collected from medical records and VistA files. When data collection is completed, analyses will be conducted to determine the effectiveness of the enhanced intervention with regard to improving guideline adherence and patient outcomes.||Status:||The project is ongoing. To date, 401 subjects have been enrolled in the intervention study. The rate of completed follow-up assessments to date is 86 percent., 0

2	"SCIT Versus TAR for Outpatients With Schizophrenia, In recent years, there has been an interest in the development of intervention programs focused on the social cognition for people with schizophrenia (Andres et al., 2001; P Penn et al. 2005). At least, five reviews and one meta-analysis have been conducted to date, which demonstrate promising results of the effectiveness of such interventions on social cognitive deficits and functional outcomes (Tan et al; 2016; Choi et al., 2009; Horan et al., 2008; Kurtz and Richardson, 2012; Statucka and Walder, 2013; Wolwer et al., 2010). Some approaches are focused on one specific domain of social cognition (""targeted"" interventions, such as the Training in Affect Recognition (TAR, Wolwer et al., 2005), and others incorporate multiple domains to create more complex, eclectic programs (""broad-based"" interventions, such as the Social Cognition and Interaction Training (SCIT; Penn et al. 2007; Kurtz & Richardson, 2012).||TAR (Frommann et al., 2003) is one of the social cognition interventions with greater empirical support (Statucka & Walder, 2016) and has been shown to effectively attenuate facial affect recognition deficits in patients with schizophrenia (Wölwer et al. 2005; Wölwer and Frommann 2011; Sachs et al. 2012; Luckhaus et al. 2013). TAR teaches compensation strategies using errorless learning principles, positive reinforcement, feature abstraction, self-instruction and, most importantly, verbalization of characteristic features of facial affect. In a randomized controlled trial, the TAR group achieved significant improvements in facial affect recognition -in particular in recognizing sad faces- and in the quality of life domain social relationship. Furthermore, the TAR training contributed to enhancing some aspects of cognitive functioning and negative symptoms (Sachs et al, 2012). In the other hand, SCIT is a 24-session manual-based group treatment, including elements of cognitive behavioral therapy and social skills training. It is designed for those with schizophrenia spectrum disorders to improve social functioning by enhancing social cognition. Across different studies and research groups, SCIT has been also shown to improve in emotion perception, theory of mind (ToM), and social functioning (Bartholomeusz et al., 2013; Combs et al., 2007; Hasson-Ohayon, 2014; Parker et al. 2013; Penn et al., 2007; Roberts & Penn, 2009; Roberts et al. 2010; Roberts et al., 2014, 2016; Wang et al., 2013).||The efficacy of both interventions has been demonstrated in randomized controlled trials compared to ""treatment as usual"", occupational therapy or cognitive remediation (Kurtz et al. 2016) but to date no study has compared the efficacy of two different social cognitive interventions (a direct comparison design). A more precise knowledge about the effect of each intervention on the 4 main domains of social cognition (affect recognition, theory of mind, attributional style and social perception) is needed, and this would enable to identify potential candidates for each program.||The present work consists of a randomized clinical trial comparing the effectiveness of two interventions based on social cognition training in outpatients with schizophrenia. The investigators sought to compare the effect of a ""targeted"" (TAR) and a ""broad-based"" (SCIT) intervention on schizophrenia patients' performance in facial affect recognition, theory of mind and attributional style. Secondarily, the investigators compare the effect on symptomatology, general cognition and functioning. The main hypothesis was that the patient group receiving TAR would exhibit a greater improvement in emotion recognition performance at the post-intervention assessment in comparison to patients receiving the SCIT, and, conversely, patients receiving SCIT would show more effect in ToM and attributional style. To assess the durability of these effects, performance in measures of social cognition, basic cognitive functioning, symptomatology and functional capacity were assessed before (T0), after treatment (T1) and 3 months later (T2).||2. Methods||2.1. Participants Outpatients who met DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder (SCID-P; First et al. 1994) with stable symptoms in the range from 18 to 65 years were included into the study. Patients were recruited from 4 Mental Healt Centers in Madrid, Barcelona, Zaragoza and Teruel (Spain). All were clinically stable, without any psychiatric hospitalizations in the last 3 months, with the same antipsychotic medication during the previous 6 weeks, and no planned change in the drug regime for the next 3 months. Exclusion criteria were: 1. Disorders other than schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, according to DSM-IV diagnosis criteria; 2. Additional axis-I or axis-II diagnosis; 3. Dependence to alcohol or other drugs (except nicotine); 4. Serious somatic disorders or organic brain damage; 5. Mental retardation or difficulty speaking or understanding the Spanish language.||The study was approved by the loval ethics committee and all participants gave their informed consent. Overall 100 participants were randomized either to TAR group (n = 49) or to the SCIT group (n = 51) (Consort diagram, Graphic 1).||2.1.1. Treatment||TAR is a 12-session training on facial affect recognition over a period of 6 weeks. Treatment includes one therapist (psychiatrist or clinical psychologist) and 2 patients. It involves neuropsychological strategies, such as restitution and compensation, as well as principles of errorless learning, direct positive reinforcement, verbalization and self-instruction (Frommann et al., 2003; Wölwer et al., 2005). The program is divided into three blocks, whereas each block consists of 4 sessions: during the first block patients learn to identify and discriminate the prototypical facial signs of the six basic emotions (happiness, sadness, fear, disgust, anger and surprise). The next block aims at a more holistic processing mode with fast decisions, relying on first impression, nonverbal processing and recognition of facial expressions with small intensities. The third block deals with the role of facial emotions in social, behavioral and situational context. Baseline assessments (T0=pre-treatment) were performed after enrolment to the study and post treatment assessments (T1=post-treatment) after the end of the training period (Sachs et al. 2012).||SCIT is a manual-based group intervention that is delivered in 20-24weekly, hour-long sessions. Groups include two clinicians and six to ten patients. SCIT uses a combination of psychoeducation, drill-and-repeat skill practice, strategy games, heuristic rehearsal, and homework assignments to remediate deficits and decrease biases in social cognition. Each SCIT group participant was encouraged to identify a 'practice partner', a family member or acquaintance who was willing to practice SCIT skills with the participant weekly in lieu of, or in addition to, traditional homework. SCIT clinicians attempted to reach practice partners by phone each week to check -in and provide guidance in their efforts to support SCIT participants' learning (Roberts et al. 2014)., social cognition|psychotherapy|rehabilitation|theory of mind"

2	Research of Anatomo-functional Biomarkers in Schizophrenia, The identification of biomarkers of ultra-resistance (UR) to treatment in schizophrenia would allow earlier, better adapted and more effective personalized management of these patients, which would improve their functional prognosis.||An early decrease in functional connectivity (FC) between some rest networks has recently been proposed as an UR biomarker by McNabb et al. Nevertheless, clozapine has, among its side effects, a direct cardiac action that profoundly modifies patient's hemodynamics. However, functional brain imaging techniques are based on BOLD effect which is dependent on these hemodynamic parameters. It is therefore not possible to say whether these differences in FC are inherent to the pathology or whether they are related to clozapine instauration which causes hemodynamic changes that may disturb BOLD signal.||To objectify UR biomarkers, investigators propose a longitudinal follow-up of resistant patients, starting before clozapine instauration and including a multimodal brain imaging assessment (T1 and T2 weighted sequences, DTI, ASL-Perfusion, fMRI- Rest) associated with clinical and biological monitoring. In order to correct the MRI signal of clozapine hemodynamic effects, investigators will develop a new MRI methodology based on the concomitant collection of physiological parameters (blood pressure, electrocardiogram and respiration)., schizo-affective disorder|utra-resistance|clozapine|biomarker|fMRI

2	Reducing Hippocampal Hyperactivity and Improving Cognition in Schizophrenia, Cognitive symptoms are not currently well-managed in Veterans with schizophrenia, leading to substantially diminished quality of life. Improved treatment strategies clearly are needed. Recent studies suggest taht an overactive hippocampus is associated with cognitive deficits in the illness. Based on findings that the anti-epileptic drug levetiracetam (LEV) reduces hippocampal activity and improves cognition in other clinical populations while being safe and well-tolerated, this study will examine the effects of the drug on hippocampal activity and cognition in Veterans with schizophrenia. In this crossover design, participants will take LEV for 4 weeks and placebo pills for 4 weeks, but will not know the order in which they are taking them., Schizophrenia

2	Effects of Eszopiclone on Sleep and Memory in Schizophrenia, Sleep spindles, a defining oscillation of stage 2 non-rapid eye movement sleep (N2), are strongly linked to memory and IQ in healthy individuals. Schizophrenia is characterized by a spindle deficit that correlates with deficient sleep-dependent memory consolidation, symptom severity, IQ and executive function. In a small pilot study of schizophrenia patients, eszopiclone , significantly increased sleep spindles but its effect on memory was not significant. Here, in a larger double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design study, we investigated whether eszopiclone can both increase spindle density and improve memory consolidation. Chronic, medicated schizophrenia outpatients and demographically-matched healthy control participants were randomly assigned to receive either placebo first or 3mg of eszopiclone first for two consecutive nights with high density polysomnography. Placebo and eszopiclone visits were one week apart. Participants were trained on the Motor Sequence Task (MST) at bedtime of the second night of each visit and tested the following morning to probe sleep-dependent motor memory consolidation., sleep|memory|schizophrenia|eszopiclone
2	The Effects of Varenicline on Cognitive Function in Patients With Schizophrenia, Cognitive deficits have been considered as a core symptom domain of schizophrenia. Amelioration of or improvement in cognitive impairments is becoming an important focus of clinical treatment development. Varenicline is a potent and selective alpha 4 beta 2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor partial agonist that has been developed for smoking cessation. In animal studies, alpha 4 beta 2 receptor agonists significantly improve working memory and attention function. Subjects will be assigned in 1:1 ratio to receive varenicline or placebo respectively. Assessments will be done using several neuropsychologic tests, clinical rating scale including assessment of nicotine withdrawal scales.Varenicline has been found to be efficacious for smoking cessation in the general population and animal studies have demonstrated the cognitive benefits of this agent. However, no published work is available evaluating the cognitive effects in humans. Thus, patients may experience improvements in cognitive function and in people who are smokers, these people may be able to achieve abstinence in smoking. This will in turn improve long-term functional outcomes and health outcomes in people with schizophrenia. This is an exciting opportunity for discovery if indeed cognitive abilities could be improved with this adjunctive treatment., Schizophrenia|Cognition|Varenicline

0	"Effect of SPG Block for Patients With Anxiety at Electronic Dance Music Festivals, Background & Rationale||Electronic dance music festivals are a growing source of entertainment in Canada. Attended by thousands at a time, it is important to have a medical team onsite to manage clinical issues in these mass gatherings. One of the most common clinical presentations at these festivals is anxiety. In a low-resource setting, it is not always possible to supply all guests with oral or injectable anti-anxiety therapy. Additionally, anti-anxiety medication is often sedating, which we would want to avoid in a patient population at higher risk of sedation (e.g., intoxication). A simple, non-sedating, alternative treatment that can be administered by a medical team member that can be given without the need of a needle would be ideal.||Anecdotal reports have noted that sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) blocks with lidocaine, intranasally, is effective for the relief of anxiety. As well, the PI has had anecdotal success in managing patient anxiety with SPG blocks. At the time of writing, there has been no published study found by our team to evaluate the efficacy of SPG blocks on anxiety.||Research Question & Objectives||Question: In electronic dance music festival attendees, who present with anxiety to the medical team, how does a 2% lidocaine-soaked cotton tip applicator, inserted into both nares until it meets resistance, compare with a saline-soaked cotton tip applicator, inserted into both nares until it meets resistance, for self-reported anxiety 10-minutes post-intervention?||The objective of this trial is to study the effectiveness of bilateral SPG block for anxiety.||Methods||All individuals, who present with anxiety to the main medical area at electronic dance music festivals in Canada, will be recruited until sample size reaches at least 70 people. Inclusion criteria will include festival attendees aged 18+ with a complaint of anxiety. Exclusion criteria will include known allergy to lidocaine (standard practice involves medical team members asking patients what allergies they have), inability to pass a cotton tip applicator through the nares (e.g., obstruction), inability to report level of anxiety, or already have taken an anti-anxiety medication (e.g., lorazepam, midazolam).||After obtaining consent, participants will be randomized into two study arms using a random number generator. Arm 1 will receive an intranasal SPG block with 2% lidocaine in each nare, applied with long cotton tip applicators. Arm 2 will receive a long cotton tip applicator soaked with saline, inserted in each nare (placebo). The cotton tip applicators will remain in the nares for 10 minutes before removal.||After randomization, participants will be asked to rate their anxiety on a numeric response scale (0 to 10, where 0 is no anxiety and 10 is ""worst anxiety imaginable"") prior to receiving their assigned intervention. 10-minutes following intervention, participants will be asked to rate their anxiety once more., 0"
1	Sensory Phenotypes of Autism Spectrum Disorder, Sensory disturbance of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are life-long highly-impairing challenges for the individual. Anxiety and fear around the sensory issues significantly threatens the psychological and mental health. As a newly introduced diagnostic criteria of ASD, sensory characteristics becomes a recent focus of ASD research. The ASD population is aging, how their sensory features naturally change with age is particular relevant for their adaptation. However, current literature are limited to childhood and young adults and mostly rely on behavioral report, lacking a clear whole picture of changing sensory phenotype in terms of different sensory modality and sensory domains. Besides, how sensory characteristics in ASD can be quantified by objective measures or explored by qualitative approach, how the sensory sensitivity contributes to the core social deficits in ASD such as eye gaze or social touch avoidance are unclear. This project plans to achieve the following aims:||Establish sensory phenotypes of a Taiwanese ASD cohort across lifespan, including variety of sensory modalities (i.e., visual, tactile, auditory, smell/taste, proprioception, etc.), sensory domains (i.e., low registration, sensory seeking, sensory sensitivity, and sensory avoiding), and clinical correlates.|Clarify the relationship between sensory phenotypes and social impairment by two specific sensory-social paradigms targeting eye gaze avoidance and social touch anxiety, which are hallmarks of ASD. Factors of emotion types as well as familiarity of faces or social/object touch will be manipulated to examine how they moderate eye tracking and pupil response.|Identify the atypical neural representation of ASD during eye gaze and viewing social touch by fMRI and EEG., 0
2	"A Study in Italy About Evidence Based Psychosocial/Rehabilitative Interventions in Patients With Early Schizophrenia Treated Continuously With Antipsychotics, Background:||The Italian document Stato Regioni (an agreement between Italian Government and local regions) analyses objectives indicated by the PANSM (Piano Nazionale di Azioni per la Salute mentale - National Plan of Actions for Mental Health) to identify pathways of care for severe mental illnesses (schizophrenia, affective disorders and severe personality disorders) which should be offered by Italian Departments of Mental Health in order to reduce the variability of treatments and to increase the quality of the service offered and the efficiency of resource use. As for schizophrenia, it is underlined the importance that the patient is offered an integrated treatment which involves a multiprofessional team and the application of several clinical and psychosocial and rehabilitative interventions based on the scientific evidence and guidelines recommendations. The proposal of activities should be linked to the patient degree of functional impairment or disability in order to improve patient's functioning and level of personal and social autonomy. This consideration is consistent with the evidence that antipsychotic therapy alone, even if effective on some clinical parameters, should be integrated with psychosocial and rehabilitative interventions to achieve better outcomes in terms of personal and social functioning and quality of life and that ""evidence-based"" (EB) psychosocial treatments (such as cognitive behaviour therapy for psychosis, cognitive remediation, family psychoeducation, social skills training and supported employment) are considered more effective than nonspecific and unstructured interventions, which, however, are more often implemented in the psychiatric services. In a Survey recently performed in Lombardia Region the frequency with which community health centers offer their patients any evidence based rehabilitative intervention has been found to be less than 10%, while a percentage of about 18% of subjects undergoing EB treatments (including supported employment) emerged in a wider national Survey promoted by the Italian Society of Psychosocial Rehabilitation (SIRP National Congress, Salerno, 2014; Italian Society of Psychiatry (SIP) National Congress, Taormina, 2015). Unfortunately, transversal or retrospective study designs do not allow to assess accurately the frequency of implementation of specific interventions, which are differently defined and applied in different contexts, and to characterize the clinical-functional features of patients assigned to any specific intervention. The Stato- Regioni document underlines also the importance of proposing an integrated multidisciplinary approach as soon as possible after the diagnosis of schizophrenia and the crucial importance of the continuity of treatment with antipsychotics from the onset of psychosis onward. Unfortunately, no data are available on the implementation of EB treatments in patients treated continuously with antipsychotics in the early phases of the disease.||In front of the importance of offering a wide range of activities to the patient, a high variability of treatments is offered in the different Italian psychiatric departments, with no data available for most Italian regions and, even in the case of the more advanced regions, with a low delivery rate of evidence-based psychosocial activities as compared with other non-evidence-based psychosocial activities.||The pharmacological continuity is a challenge as well. Literature data confirm the importance of poor adherence which may cause not only the occurrence of relapses and re-hospitalizations but also other negative outcomes for the patient, such as the inability to access and maintain rehabilitative interventions and reintegration. Treatment with antipsychotics of patients suffering from schizophrenia should provide a good balance between efficacy, safety, tolerability and acceptability for the patient to determine the continuity and the use of long-acting injection (LAI) antipsychotics is an effective response to these problems, ensuring better outcomes than oral treatment. In addition, drug treatment applied promptly and continuously is particularly important in order to prevent relapses in the early stages of schizophrenia thus limiting the functional deterioration which generally occurs within the first 5-10 years after the first episode and the clinical and psychosocial deterioration which occurs mostly within the first 5 years from the onset of the illness. Moreover, there is evidence in the literature that treatment of first episode patients with a LAI atypical antipsychotic increases treatment acceptability, adherence and the rate of sustained remission.||Given all these premises the investigators are interested in observing how often Evidence Based (EB) psychosocial and rehabilitative interventions are actually offered to patients in the real world clinical practice of psychiatric Italian services able to deliver this kind of treatments, focusing on a cohort of patients with recent onset schizophrenia, for whom delivery of integrated treatments is especially recommended, treated continuously with LAI antipsychotics.||Study objectives:||The primary objective of this study is to explore the level of implementation of EB psychosocial/rehabilitative treatments during a prospective 12-month period in patients with recent onset schizophrenia (< 5 years) being treated with a LAI Antipsychotic in Psychiatric Departments with expertise in the application of such interventions and to describe the reasons of implementing the particular EB psychosocial intervention and the clinical-functional characteristics of patients assigned to these treatments. The prospective design is strictly required both for allowing consistent definition and application of such interventions and for describing reliably the characteristics of patients assigned to these treatments.||Secondary objectives are to describe the reasons for the choice of the specific assigned psychosocial intervention (if any) and the clinical and functional treatment outcomes of patients assigned or not-assigned to EB psychosocial therapies.||Study design:||Prospective, observational, naturalistic study conducted according to Italian law.||The assignment of a patient to any particular treatment is not decided in advance by the study protocol, but falls within current clinical practice.||No additional diagnostic or monitoring tools apply to individuals, with the exceptions listed and allowed by the Italian legislation. The administration of questionnaires and scales is accepted by Italian law regarding non-interventional studies.||All the parameters will be evaluated when available and collected for patient care.||A scientific committee approves the scientific rationale of the protocol and approves the final report.||The study will be conducted according to the protocol, the current version of the Declaration of Helsinki, the guidelines of Pharmacoepidemiology, and the Italian applicable regulations. According to the latter, patients will sign a written informed consent to participate. For each center involved, the investigator will provide all information to the subjects involved in the study in a form that the person is able to understand, and will obtain written consent before the collection of personally identifiable information. The data of consenting patients will be recorded in an electronic database.||Diagnosis and main criteria for inclusion / exclusion||Inclusion criteria:||- Patients with schizophrenia (F20 according TO International Classification Deseases ICD-10 version 2013)||Onset of schizophrenia, defined as the first onset of symptoms that required specific antipsychotic treatment or hospitalization, as derived from anamnesis or available clinical documentation, not more than 5 years before study entry|Age between 18 and 40 years|Patients under treatment with a LAI on the basis of physician's decision (LAI started no longer than 6 months before study entry) and clinically stable (no relapse requiring hospitalization or change of treatment due to clinical worsening) during the last 1 month.||Endpoints:||Primary outcome of interest (""endpoint"") is percentage of patients within the total study population who have been assigned to any EB psychosocial/rehabilitative treatment (listed below) for at least 1 month consecutively during the 12-month observation period (given the heterogeneity of interventions, this is an arbitrary duration which may reliably indicate a significant exposure to a given intervention). The percentage of each type of psychosocial intervention delivered together with frequency of sessions and length of treatment, and the reasons (categorized) given by the clinicians to justify the selected psychosocial intervention as well as the clinical-functional characteristics of patients assigned to these treatments will be described. Patient assignment to the different interventions and their delivery will be traced in the patients' clinical charts.

The increase in the CGI score must take the patient to be at least moderately ill (CGI = 4).||Additional endpoints:||- Health economic information collected through 3 specific questionnaires: detection of i) health resources consumption for the care of the disorder (direct costs, eg. drug cost, hospitalization, emergency visits, Day hospitals, General Physician visits…) and assessment of indirect costs through evaluation of : ii) patient's potential income loss, absenteeism and presenteeism to estimate work productivity, daily activity impairment due to the mental illness and of iii) caregiver's potential income loss, commitment of time for the patient's care, absenteeism and presenteeism to estimate work productivity, daily activity impairment because of the patient's mental illness.||Exploratory analyses||If data collected will allow, exploratory analyses will be done to compare clinical and functional outcomes among the potential group stratifications which are expected to be composed by:||A. Patients treated with EB interventions B. Patients treated with non-EB interventions C. Patients who did not receive any EB or non-EB psychosocial/rehabilitative treatment||Evaluation criteria/study assessments:||Patients are seen in the context of usual clinical practice and data will be collected at baseline, and after 3, 6 and 12 months after recruitment. This visit program remains indicative, ie the intervals between visits are the usual intervals of each center and the closest to the expected time assessments will be considered for the study evaluations.||Health economic information will be collected at 6 and 12 months||Statistics and sample size calculation||The primary variable of interest (primary endpoint) will be the proportion of the recruited patients who, in the course of the 12-month follow-up, will be assigned to at least 1 month of EB psychosocial treatment/rehabilitation.||Currently, reliable estimates of such proportion are not available and, in fact, this is expected to be surveyed through this study. In a Survey recently performed in Lombardia Region the frequency with which community health centers offer their patients any evidence based rehabilitative intervention has been found to be less than 10% , while in a wider national Survey about 18% of included subjects were receiving any kind of EB treatment, including supported employment. No data at all are available on the implementation of EB psychosocial treatments in patients treated continuously with antipsychotics in the early phases of the disease. However, the investigators believe that the proportion of patients on EB rehabilitative interventions in this study could be higher than those reported above. The participating centres are, in fact, able to apply effective EB psychosocial interventions. Moreover, the survey applies to patients in the early phases of schizophrenia (< 5 years of illness), i.e. a group of patients who should be assigned systematically to an integrated care according to the Stato- Regioni document, and more adherent to medication since treated continuously with LAI antipsychotics. As the reliability of results depends on the proportion of patients on EB interventions, and as this proportion is still to be defined, the investigators will use an hypothetical percentage of 50% in determining the sample size needed for a given level of accuracy. This assumption will prevent the investigators from having an underpowered survey.||Eighteen is the number of centres identified and recruited to participate in the study. Overall, in 2014, 29527 patients were in charge at those centres. Of these, 4034 (14%) had a clinical presentation compatible with a diagnosis of schizophrenia (F20 according to ICD-10 version 2013) and 1462 (5%) were also being in therapy with LAI antipsychotics. On the basis of these data, it is estimated that eligible patients, namely those having a history of recent illness (<5 years), are approximately 1000, i.e.55 per centre. According to an initial feasibility assessment, it is expected that each centre could include at least 15 patients. Providing a proportion of patients lost to follow-up almost irrelevant, given the ease of detection of the variable of interest, this will produce a sample of prevalence of 270 individuals with a two-tailed 95% Confidence Interval (CI) with a margin of error of around 5%.||The clinical and functional characteristics of patients assigned to EB psychosocial treatment / rehabilitation will be described.||Descriptive statistical analyses will be carried out by calculating the arithmetic mean and standard deviation (median and interquartile range for data with skewed distributions) for quantitative variables, and absolute frequency and percentage for qualitative variables. In addition, calculations will be made of the relevant confidence intervals (95%) for the clinically relevant variables.||If possible, exploratory comparisons of clinical and functional variables associated with the group stratifications generated naturalistically will be conducted.||The data will be entered into a database specifically created for the purposes of this study.||Statistical analyses will be made with Statistical Analysis System (SAS) version 9.2 and values of P <0.05 will be considered statistically significant., psychosocial/rehabilitative interventions|Schizophrenia|evidence based interventions|long acting injection antipsychotic|functional outcome"

2	Efficacy of Bifeprunox in Patients With Schizophrenia, Schizophrenia is a serious and disabling mental disorder that affects approximately 1% of the world's population. There are a number of antipsychotic drugs in use but none is ideal, in particular because their safety profile is complex and their effectiveness is limited. In particular, after having overcome acute exacerbations many patients continue to experience significant symptoms that prevent an adequate functioning. In the current study, patients suffering from schizophrenia and currently in a post-acute maintenance phase of the disease will be included. Non-treatment resistant patients will be included in the study, since they have partially responded to their current antipsychotic treatment but still have clinically significant symptoms and/or impairment of functioning in their daily life. The study is a 12-month study with an initial 12-week placebo-controlled, quetiapine-referenced phase. After this initial 12-week phase, the patients allocated to placebo will be switched to bifeprunox. In the final non-inferiority analysis of the 12-month data, the results from this study will be combined with the data from a similar study (11915A)., Schizophrenia|Antipsychotic|Bifeprunox
0	Assessing Patient Anxiety During Mohs Micrographic Surgery, There has been a continual increase in cases of nonmelanoma skin cancer and melanoma over the last several decades. With the increase in incidence, there is also the need for increased treatment. Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) is highly efficacious, with cure rates in the upper 90% for both basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, the two most common forms of skin cancer. MMS is used for tumors in cosmetically sensitive areas or areas of recurrence.||While MMS is usually performed in the outpatient setting, it may be an anxiety provoking experience for patients, ranging from the fear of a cancer diagnosis, to concerns about the procedural events of the surgery and associated pain, to the anticipation of their final cosmetic result. During a MMS procedure, unlike many other types of surgery or procedures, the patient is awake and aware of his or her surroundings, with periods of waiting interspersed throughout the procedure. Such aspects can lead to the high level of perioperative anxiety in MMS patients. The effects of listening to music, watching preoperative informational videos, and the use of web-based applications have been used to attempt to decrease anxiety in MMS patients. However, causes for differences in anxiety level between first time MMS patients and patients returning for a subsequent MMS procedure are not well characterized.||One approach to reduce patient anxiety involves patient education, where patients are presented statistics about the small likelihood of complication from the MMS procedure. However, patients interpret these data very subjectively. The study team proposes an alternative approach to patient education through patient vignettes. A previous study explored using a narrative video that included patient testimonials, but this video also used patient-physician interaction and drawings. In this study, patients will be provided short vignettes, that would include information about the experience of a typical MMS patient., Mohs Micographic Surgery|skin cancer|melanoma
2	Cognitive Behavioral Social Skills Training for Improving Social Functioning in People With Schizophrenia, Schizophrenia is a chronic, severe, and disabling brain disorder. People with schizophrenia sometimes hear voices others don't hear, believe that others are broadcasting their thoughts to the world, or become convinced that others are plotting to harm them. These symptoms make it difficult for people with schizophrenia to interact normally and establish healthy social relationships with others. Cognitive Behavioral Social Skills Training (CBSST) is a group behavioral therapy intervention that focuses on improving cognitive and metacognitive impairments and social skills deficits that interfere with normal functioning in people with schizophrenia. Goal-focused supportive contact (GFSC) is a group therapy intervention that focuses on helping people with schizophrenia to verbalize their problems or worries and to seek advice from fellow group members. This study evaluated the effectiveness of CBSST versus GFSC in improving social functioning in people with schizophrenia. The study will assessed changes in cognition, psychotic symptoms, and use of psychiatric healthcare services.||Participants in this open label study were randomly assigned to one of the following treatment groups: treatment as usual (TAU) plus CBSST or TAU plus GFSC. Both interventions consist of 2-hour therapy sessions weekly for 36 weeks. Groups receiving each intervention do not exceed ten people. CBSST integrates cognitive therapy, social skills training, and neurocognitive compensatory aids. Cognitive therapy helps participants challenge unhelpful thoughts and build communication and problem-solving skills. Participants receive workbooks that describe the skills and contain homework assignments. GFSC focuses on empowering participants to share problems, worries, or concerns with others who face similar issues. Participants share advice with each other, but therapists do not teach skills. Outcomes were be assessed at Months 4.5, 9, 15, and 21 for all participants., Psychotic Disorders|Schizoaffective Disorder|Cognitive Behavioral Therapy|Social Skills Training

2	A Double-blind and Randomized Trial of Celecoxib Added to Risperidone in Treatment-naive First-episode Schizophrenia, OBJECTIVE: Evidences of high levels of activating cytokines in the CSF and signs of CNS inflammation have suggested that an inflammatory/immunological pathogenesis may exist in a subgroup of schizophrenic patients. We hypothesize that anti-inflammatory therapy by using an add-on agent together with a well-proven neuroleptic may have favorable effects on some schizophrenic patients.||METHODS:||Clinical Trial: This is a randomized, double-blind and parallel controlled trial in treatment-naive first-episode patients with schizophrenia. The study consists of a 1-week stabilization phase, followed by 12 weeks of double-blind treatment. The total trial duration is 13 weeks.|Assessment Procedures:||2.1. Primary Outcome Variable-psychopathology: Assessment instruments include the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) (Kay et al, 1987), the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) (Andreasen 1981) and the Clinical Global Impression (ICG). Patients are interviewed at screening, at week-4, at week-1, at baseline and at every two weeks, for a total of 12 ratings.||2.2. Cognitive tests: A comprehensive battery of tests encompassing the cognitive domains of executive function, attention, memory, perception, and general intellect is administered twice at baseline and at the end of 16-week treatment by a trained psychologist. Scoring follows standardized procedures. The Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) (Heaton et al, 1993) is administered as a measure of executive function. The N-back (0-3 back) test is administered as a measure of working memory. Logical Memory I and II, Verbal Paired Associates I and II, Visual Reproduction I and II and Digits Forward from the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R) (Wechsler, 1987) are administered as a tests of episodic memory. The Distractibility version of Gordon Continuous Performance Test (CPT)is administered as a test of attention. A four-subtest version of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R), (Wechsler, 1981; Missar et al, 1994) consisting of the Arithmetic, Similarities, Picture Completion, and Digit Symbol Substitution tests is administered to obtain an estimate of current Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient (FSIQ).||2.3. Side Effects: Parkinsonism is rated with the Simpson-Angus Scale for extrapyramidal side effects (SAS, Simpson and Angus, 1970). The Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) (Guy, 1978) is chosen to assess tardive dyskinesia (TD) severity. All of the AIMS and Simpson-Angus Rating Scales are administered by the same investigator, at screening, at week-4, at week-1, at baseline and at baseline and at every two weeks, for a total of 12 ratings.||2.4.Serum Measures: IL-2, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 concentrations, Schizophrenia|clinical trial|risperidone|immune|celecoxib
2	Role of Antioxidants (Vitamin C and E) in the Management of Schizophrenia, Background: Antioxidants such as Vitamin C and E are substances that are considered as a defensive material which protects cells from destruction. It is evident that use of food stuff rich in antioxidant will fortify one's ability to encounter with physical & mental disorders. Since, among several potential elucidations, oxidation stress is more likely deliberated as one of the causative factors which give rise to cognitive and functional impairment. Therefore, this study was conducted with objectives to explore the role of selected antioxidants (vitamin C & E) and to compare the role of both vitamins as an add-on management of schizophrenia .Materials & Methods: One hundred and five patients were selected from department of psychiatry King Edward Medical University Lahore, and assigned into 3 groups by simple random lottery method. For the period of two months, Vitamin C group intervened with 500 mg vitamin C tablet once a day, vitamin E group with 600 I U vitamin E twice daily and placebo group was given 500 mg paraffin oil capsule daily. PANSS (Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale) was used to assess the symptoms of schizophrenia. Demographic information was collected by structured questionnaire. Dietary habits were assessed by (FFQ) food frequency questionnaire., Positive and Negative syndrome scale (PANSS)|Antioxidants|Schizophrenia
2	Endocannabinoid Control of Microglia Activation as a New Therapeutic Target in the Treatment of Schizophrenia, Schizophrenia is a chronic and severe mental disorder with an urgent need for new and more effective treatments. A promising novel pharmacological target in this respect is the endocannabinoid system. In particular the cannabinoid compound cannabidiol (CBD) displays a highly favourable profile for development as a new antipsychotic agent. Increasing evidence indicates a significant role for neuroinflammation in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, especially for activation of resident macrophages of the brain: microglia. Interestingly, converging preclinical evidence suggests that microglia activation is under control of the endocannabinoid system. However, how manipulation of the endocannabinoid system affects microglia activation in humans has not been established, but it is presumably related to clinical improvement of schizophrenia patients.||In this project, we propose to study endocannabinoid control of microglia activation as a new therapeutic target in the treatment of schizophrenia. Using a placebo-controlled, randomised, double-blind design, we will investigate this in a group of 36 recent-onset schizophrenia patients after four weeks of daily CBD treatment, in addition to their regular antipsychotic medication. First, we will examine if CBD treatment attenuates microglia activation and levels of peripheral inflammatory markers. In vivo microglia activation is assessed before and after treatment using 1H-MRS, with the level of myo-inositol being regarded as a marker of glia function. Second, we will determine if reduced microglia activation and levels of inflammatory markers relate to improvement of symptomatology and cognitive function. Third, we will assess how microglia activation and levels of inflammatory markers before treatment predict the clinical response to CBD., Schizophrenia|Cannabidiol|Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (1H-MRS)|Microglia

2	Inpatient Evaluation of Adults With Schizophrenia, Objectives:||Schizophrenia and related psychoses are chronic brain disorders whose prognosis is often poor and whose pathophysiology remains obscure. Neuroimaging technologies such as PET (positron emission tomography), fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging), DTI (diffusion tensor imaging) and MRSI (magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging) offer opportunities to elucidate the pathophysiology by studying brain function in living research subjects. The use of these techniques to study psychotic disorders is severely limited, however, by a critical methodological confound: antipsychotic treatment. The purpose of this protocol is to admit research subjects with schizophrenia and other related disorders to the Clinical Center, carefully evaluate their neuropsychiatric status, and discontinue psychotropic medications for a brief period so research subjects can be studied without the confound of antipsychotic treatment.||Study Population:||700 participants||The study will include research subjects with schizophrenia.||Study Design:||There are several phases to this protocol. The first phase is the Screening Evaluation and Stabilization Phase and includes gathering historical data, structured diagnostic interviews, general physical and laboratory assessments, basic physiological monitoring, neuropsychological testing, limited collection of blood and urine samples, and serial behavioral ratings. In the second phase (Coded Medication Phase), research subjects will receive blinded compounds that will contain inactive placebo or active antipsychotic administered in a crossover fashion. Patients and unit clinical nursing staff evaluating and caring for the patient will be blind to arm status. Each arm normally lasts 4 to 6 weeks. The total duration of this phase is 8 to 12 weeks. During the Coded Medication Phase, research subjects are enrolled in a series of neuroimaging and other approved studies designed to elucidate the neurobiology of these disorders. These include studies using neuropsychological testing, MEG, PET, fMRI, DTI, and MRSI. The antipsychotic free period is essential to distinguish the effects of illness versus medication.||Outcome Measures:||Parameters under investigation include traits that are candidate phenotypes for genetic studies and state-dependent aspects of brain function. The combined use of many neuroimaging modalities will allow us to look at the functional relationship between a variety of brain abnormalities hypothesized to play a role in schizophrenia. These include hippocampal neurochemical abnormalities, deficits in prefrontal cortical activation, and dysregulation of subcortical dopamine in a single research subject., Schizophrenia|Psychosis|Schizoaffective|Neuroimaging|Cognition|Schizoaffective Disorder

Assessment of anxiety (Pre-test) of the hospitalized children admitted in Aashirwad Hospital was done in experimental group and Comparison group on 1st day. In Experimental group after taking pretest play interventions were introduced to the children and instructions regarding the way to play with all the interventions were provided to the children. Though all the children were free to choose the play yet the younger children were given simple and easy play interventions such as drawing, coloring etc. to obtain more sensory experience whereas the older children were offered play interventions such as puzzle, building blocks, ludo etc. with high cognitive demand. The play interventions were administered for 1 hour daily from day 1 to day 5 whereas in Comparison group all the subjects were given usual general nursing and medical care for continuous 5 days. No intervention was administered to the comparison group.

2	A Study to Evaluate the Effectiveness and Safety of 3 Doses of Paliperidone Palmitate in Treating Subjects With Schizophrenia, This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter, dose-response study of patients who have a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM IV) diagnosis of schizophrenia. The duration of the study is approximately 14 weeks, including a screening period of 1 week and a 13-week double-blind treatment period. Efficacy and safety will be evaluated periodically throughout the study. Samples for pharmacokinetic evaluation will be collected at designated time points, and a blood sample will be collected at baseline (before the start of double-blind treatment) for an optional pharmacogenomics (genetics) analysis. The hypothesis is that the 3 fixed doses of paliperidone are each more efficacious than placebo in treating subjects with schizophrenia. The effectiveness is measured primarily by the change in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale for Schizophrenia (PANSS), and secondarily, by the investigator's Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) and by the investigator's evaluation of the patient on a Personal and Social Performance (PSP) Scale. Four injections of paliperidone palmitate 50, 100, or 150 milligrams equivalent administered in the gluteal muscle (buttocks). Injections will be given on Days 1, 8, 36, and 64 of the double-blind treatment period of the study., schizophrenia|intramuscular injection|antipsychotic agents|dementia praecox|paliperidone palmitate|mental disorders|PANSS.
2	"TMS Enhancement of Visual Plasticity in Schizophrenia, Learning and memory impairments are commonly observed in schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Alterations in ""long-term potentiation"" (LTP), a basic mechanism underlying learning and memory, may explain this impairment. This project will assess fMRI visual plasticity, thought to reflect LTP, in participants with and without schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Previous studies have shown that visual plasticity is impaired in schizophrenia. The major goal is to determine if Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) enhances visual plasticity in schizophrenia. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) provides a non-invasive means for altering brain electrical neural activity. TMS sessions (sham/placebo and real TMS) will be conducted before two MRI scans with two weeks in-between to assess whether TMS stimulation to the visual cortex will enhance visual plasticity in patients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. This project may provide a better understanding of the underlying neurobiological mechanisms responsible for learning and memory deficits in schizophrenia., 0"

0	Therapeutic Communication Training of the Stretcher Bearers on the Patient Anxiety (STRESSCOM), Anxiety is a form of psychic and/or physical discomfort caused by the feeling of the imminence of a danger. It is a normal reaction of adaptation and defense face to a situation lived as hostile. It is a frequent perioperative manifestation. Patients who need an intervention are indeed 20% more anxious than the general population. The occurrence of this anxiety can have consequences for perioperative medical care influencing morbidity and mortality.||Pharmacological premedication initially prescribed in the 19th century to limit the adverse effects of general anesthesia is currently used to fight perioperative anxiety. However, its effects are now considered as controversial.||and non-drug techniques have been studied. They have the advantage of being inexpensive and causing little or no adverse effects.||Therapeutic communication can be defined as a relational technique that seeks to separate the patient from the surrounding reality to provide analgesia or anxiolysis through the suggestion of positive images with a chosen verbal and nonverbal approach.||The knowledge of communication techniques resulting from hypnosis by the healthcare team could therefore optimize patient medical care in terms of analgesia and the management of perioperative anxiety. Therapeutic communication training in the operating room is short and accessible to all members of the team regardless of their rank. This is a training provided internally by a certified practitioner in therapeutic hypnosis, aiming to give to the professionals knowledge to optimize the patient support. At the hospital (Groupement des Hôpitaux de l'Institut Catholique de Lille), several stretcher bearers have been trained in therapeutic communication and are already applying it routinely.||No study has yet investigated the impact of the use of therapeutic communication in the operating room to control the level of anxiety of patients.||This study is prospective, monocentric, comparative, double blind. Two groups of patients will be compared: In the first group patients will be accompanied to the operating room by a stretcher-bearer trained in therapeutic communication, in the second group patients will be accompanied by a stretcher bearer without this specific training., Therapeutic communication|Anxiety|Endoscopic examination under general anesthesia|Operating room|Stretcher bearer

This study comprises a screening period of not more than 7 days and a 13-week open-label treatment period. Paliperidone palmitate will be administered as intramuscular injection (injection of a substance into a muscle) of 150 milligram equivalent (mg eq.) at baseline, 100 mg eq. at Day 8, flexible dose on Day 36 (50 or 100 mg eq.) and on Day 64 (50, 100 or 150 mg eq.) depending on investigator's discretion. Risperidone LAI will be administered at a dose of 25 mg at Day 8 and Day 22, flexible dose on Day 36 (25 or 37.5 mg) and Day 64 (25, 37.5, or 50 mg). Dose on Day 50 is the same as Day 36 and dose on Day 78 is the same as Day 64. Participants will receive oral risperidone tablets (1 to 6 mg/day) for the first 4 weeks of the open-label treatment period. Each participant may receive oral risperidone tablets (1 to 2 mg daily) for up to 3 weeks at Day 36 and Day 64 if the dose of risperidone LAI was increased on Day 36 and Day 64.

1	EEG Studies of Sensory Processing in Autistic Children, Specific Aims:||Aim 1: To recruit 75 children with autism and 75 age- and sex-matched controls ages 6 to 8 years old for an electrophysiological study and to characterize the subjects using appropriate instruments for autism diagnosis, language functioning and behavior/sensory profile, and to measure head circumferences Aim 2: To acquire and analyze event-related potential (ERP) data in the auditory and visual modality.||ERP Hypothesis: Increased amplitude, altered morphology, impaired temporal discrimination and delayed responsiveness will be found early in the processing hierarchy, and the severity of these abnormalities will be associated with the severity of dysfunction at higher levels of cortical processing.||Aim 3: To acquire EEG data and to analyze it quantitatively. Quantitative EEG Hypothesis: Both interhemispheric and intrahemispheric coherence measures of the EEG will be significantly deviant from those in the normal sample and predicted by abnormalities of ERPs. In addition, EEG background alpha activity will show post mature (i.e. higher) frequencies (Hz) than would be expected for age and focal epileptiform activity and slowing (i.e. paroxysmal theta) will predict dysfunction on the ERPs.||Rationale:||The goal of this grant is to use electrophysiological measures to characterize abnormalities in gating and timing in the autistic brain. The motivation for this research project derives from findings and models in autism of increased excitation/inhibition ratios, increased brain and white matter volume and altered connectivity. These changes, alone and in combination, have the potential to alter the intensity, timing and integration of signaling at multiple stages of processing. These signaling problems can potentially lead to the autistic behavioral phenotype through cognitive processing abnormalities including the hyperspecificity/overselectivity of autism, as well as to such features of autism as sensory processing abnormalities, seizures, and anxiety. We believe that characterizing abnormalities related to gating and timing phenomena may lead to the development of an electrophysiological battery that can be utilized for early diagnosis, prognosis and subtyping of autism, as well as the tracking of treatment efficacy.||Subjects:||Subjects will be recruited from the general population, the Ladders Clinic at MGH/Spaulding Hospital, where the PI, Dr. Martien, is employed as a clinician, as well as from the clinical practice of Dr. Herbert at the MGH-Institute of Health Professions preschool clinic. Flyers will be placed on available bulletin boards at the two clinics and throughout the greater Boston area, particularly at all Partners, Harvard, MIT, hospital, clinic, research, and educational settings.||The study will seek to enroll eighty 75, 6 to 8 year olds with autism and 75 age and sex matched controls. Children will be considered for inclusion in the autism group if:||English is the primary language in the home|Experimental group: Child meets criteria for autism on the ADI-R and ADOS evaluation scales (this inclusion criteria will be explained during the consent process).||They meet non of the Exclusionary criteria, which include:||Known genetic disorder|Hearing or gross sensorimotor deficits|Clinical evidence of progressive encephalopathy|Asphyxia at birth or any other time|Frequent seizures or use of anticonvulsant drugs or psychotropic medication|Known presence of focal brain lesions, brain atrophy or ventriculomegaly. Children will be considered for the control group if the child meets all of the above criteria except they do not meet the criteria for autism or close to it on the ADOS and ADI-R evaluation scales.||Methods:||The child will be seated in a comfortable chair and the physiological assessment will begin after a head circumference is obtained with a tape measure, an EEG cap is placed on the child's head and gel is applied to each electrode in the cap. The tasks include 5 minutes of baseline EEG recording while the child is looking at a design on a monitor placed 2 meters in front of the chair. We then will proceed with a series of auditory and visual stimuli presented by computer through two speakers placed 1 meter in front of the child (auditory) and strobe (visual) at 50 cm. The paradigms will include a presentation of pairs of tones with variable interstimulus intervals presented in random order at 65 dB SPL, a paradigm with either 1000 Hz or 800 Hz at 65 dB, and a final auditory paradigm with two different phonemes, presented at 65 dB. The visual tasks will involve the presentation of flashes of light which vary in frequency and luminance both reflected off a white board one meter from the child and directly at the child's visual field. In each series, there will be a 1 minute break between two blocks of 100 trials each for a total of 200 trials. The experimenter will show the child an interesting toy and talk to the child during the break.||The parent will be asked to complete the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, the Communication and Symbolic Behavior Scales (CSBS) and the MacArthur Communicative Development Inventory. In the case that the subjects are recruited from the Ladders infant sib study, we will use the existing ADI-R and ADOS data because Ladders has authorized the release of this information.||The total time for the laboratory session will be approximately 1 hour. The full battery of tasks will be performed on compliant children. For those children whose attention cannot be maintained for the full battery, the examiner will stop and give breaks as needed. The examiner will go on to the next task or terminate the session if the subject or parent of the subject chooses to do so., autism|pervasive developmental disorder|evoked potentials|EEG|Coherence
0	"Web-based Interpretation Training For Anxiety, Approximately half of the U.S. population experiences serious mental health problems during their lifetime, including 29% with anxiety pathology severe enough to qualify for an anxiety disorder diagnosis [1]. Critically, more than two thirds of individuals struggling with a mental illness do not receive treatment [1]. With this level of mental illness burden, it is clear that treating people one-on-one in an office setting will never meet the existing needs [2]. There are many barriers to treatment, including costs [3], difficulties accessing evidence-based treatments in many regions [4], and associated stigma [5]. Thus, there is a pressing need to consider alternative, larger scale approaches to delivering mental health services. Cognitive Bias Modification (CBM) interventions hold considerable promise as a way to meet these needs, especially for anxiety difficulties [6]. These computer-based programs are designed to alter biased ways of thinking, such as a tendency toward negative interpretations, which cause and maintain anxiety [6]. Because these programs do not require therapist contact and can be administered on any computer with an Internet connection, CBM holds promise as a cost-effective method that can be disseminated widely. However, while CBM for interpretation bias (CBM-I) has established efficacy when administered in-person in the laboratory [7], it now needs to be tested with broader populations using a web-based infrastructure to examine: a) whether the program will be effective in a web environment, b) whether the program continues to engage the targeted mechanism (i.e., interpretation bias), c) the feasibility of this delivery method, and d) the modifications needed to adapt the program for the web (in particular, to prime anxiety-linked negative thinking in an online environment, we test the effect of adding a guided anxious imagery exercise to prime feared outcomes prior to each training session).||Together, the current proposal will develop an infrastructure to pilot test the effectiveness of web-based CBM-I for anxiety symptoms. CBM-I training will target moderate to severe anxiety symptoms, a widespread problem area with considerable occupational and social impairment [8]. Participants will be visitors to Project Implicit Mental Health (PIMH), an existing website directed by the Principal Investigator that allows visitors to assess their cognitive biases tied to mental health concerns. Consistent with the RFA's priorities, this approach encourages efficiencies by capitalizing on the existing PIMH site and its heavy traffic. Further, the site's large number of visitors and use of automated assessments will make it efficient to assess baseline demographic characteristics and interpretation bias as moderators of CBM-I effects that can be tested in future trials.||Aim 1: Develop and evaluate usability and acceptability of web-based CBM-I for anxiety symptoms.||Aim 1 will build the web-based interpretation bias training program using the PIMH infrastructure. We will pilot the program on a small test group of moderate to highly anxious participants (N=15) who will complete questionnaires and semi-structured interviews to provide feedback on the programs' usability and acceptability. Further, an advisory board (N=8) of anxiety researchers, clinicians, and experts in CBM and web-based research will provide feedback on the program and study protocol. Using a ""deployment-focused"" approach, this feedback from experts and end-users will be used to iteratively modify the program for the trial planned for Aims 2 and 3. Thus, even at this initial pilot stage, we will measure the targeted outcome (anxiety symptoms) and mechanism (interpretation bias) to determine whether modifications to enhance target engagement are needed. Note, within Research Domain Criteria (RDoC), this outcome falls under the Potential Threat/Anxiety construct within the Negative Valence System, and the targeted mechanism (interpretation bias) falls under the Response Selection, Inhibition construct within the Cognitive (effortful) control system. Both the outcome and mechanism will be objectively measured using multiple units of analysis (e.g., behavior and self-report). Further, mechanisms underlying the guided anxious imagery prime's effects will be measured by assessing subjective distress, imagery vividness, and activation of feared outcomes following the manipulation. This prime was selected in part because of its potential to be disseminated widely in future trials, given it does not require human contact.||Aim 2: Test target engagement, feasibility and effectiveness of web-based CBM-I.||Aim 3: Evaluate the impact of an anxious prime on web-based CBM-I for anxiety symptoms.||Aims 2 and 3 will test the feasibility of an 8-session web-based interpretation training program among individuals with moderate to severe anxiety symptoms (based on screening at the PIMH site). Participants will be randomly assigned to positive CBM-I (90% positive scenario training), 50% positive/50% negative CBM-I, or a no scenario control condition. Half the participants in each of these 3 conditions will receive an anxious imagery prime prior to each training session, and half will receive a neutral imagery prime, resulting in a 3 training condition x 2 prime design (N=210; target of n=35 per condition). Feasibility will be determined by analyses of recruitment, attrition, acceptance of randomization, adherence to and appropriateness of the measurement model, caseness, extent of missing data, and safety. Additionally, target engagement (change in interpretation bias) and preliminary tests of effectiveness at reducing anxiety symptoms will be evaluated., Anxiety|Cognitive bias|Telemedicine"

1	Developing Treatment, Treatment Validation and Treatment Scope in the Setting of an Autism Clinical Trial, Growing evidence supports oxidative stress may contribute to autism. Docosa Hexanoic Acid(DHA)is a normal substance that is present in large amounts in the brain and can be used by the body to produce natural antioxidants. Our hope is that supplementing DHA in individuals with autism may improve some aspects of their functioning. Specifically our aims are:||Aim 1. To assess the effect of DHA vs. placebo treatment on the global severity of child and adolescent autistic disorder, via a 12-week double blind placebo-controlled parallel study. Global severity will be assessed by the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Generic (ADOS-G) and additionally in younger children by the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale.||Aim 2. To assess the effect of DHA vs. placebo treatment on behavioral symptoms and functional ability in children with autism. Assessment will be by the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC)-Community Version11.||Aim 3. To develop an improved protocol and study design based upon these studies for future large scale studies of DHA in the autistic population.||Aim 4. Monitor the effects of therapy on the isoprostane biomarker. Aim 5: Develop additional biomarkers that correlate with autism and with therapy. We will extend the analyses to neuroprostanes and resolvins. We will measure: (i) Urinary excretion of the isoprostane metabolites, 2,3 Dinor-5,6 dihydro-PGF2t and iPF4α-VI. (ii) DHA derived resolvins D2, D4, D5 and D6 and neuroprotectin.||Aim 6: Confirm our preliminary results by correlating increased isoprostane excretion with GSTM1*0 copy number in individuals with autism.||Aim 7: In the same way, correlate GSTM1*0 copy number with response to therapy assessed by diminution of isoprostane excretion during therapy.||Aim 8: Study additional biomarkers developed through Hypothesis #2 for correlation with GSTM1*0 copy number and response to therapy to identify additional gene-biomarker correlations.||Aim 9: Study additional polymorphisms of genes related to DHA metabolism, for association with autism, gene-biomarker correlations, and correlation with response to therapy., 0
2	"A Study of Paliperidone Palmitate in Japanese Patients With Schizophrenia, This is an open-label, flexible-dose, multicenter study. The study will consist of 3 periods: an up-to-2-week pre-observation (screening) period, an observation period from Day 1 (baseline) to Week 49 (end of observation period) assessment, and a post-observation period from after the Week 49 (end-of-observation period) assessment to Week 57. For the patients who discontinue the study before the last assessment in Week 49, the post observation period will start after the discontinuation from observation period assessment with follow-up visits at 4, 8, and 12 weeks after the last injection. The total duration of the study will be 57 weeks, including the observation and post observation periods. Approximately 200 men and women, aged 20 years or older who meet the DSM-IV-TR criteria for schizophrenia at least 1 year before screening and have a Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score of 60 to 120 at screening and baseline will be enrolled, so that at least 100 patients complete this 1-year study. The patients who have a primary active Axis I disorder other than schizophrenia will not be enrolled in the study. Eligible patients will be administered an initial loading dose of paliperidone palmitate 150 mg eq. im on Day 1 and 100 mg eq. 1 week later in the deltoid muscle. The study drug will be administered in a flexible dose range of 25 to 150 mg eq. at 4-week intervals from Week 5 as either deltoid or gluteal muscle injections for a total of 11 injections. A dose of 75 mg eq. is recommended from Week 5 until Week 45. The study drug will be administered by a study drug manager and/or injector. Each dose increase should be in increments of 50 mg eq. or less. Dose increases can be considered if there is an increase in the PANSS total score (individual items or the total) or the Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S) score from the preceding assessment. Dose decreases can be considered if adverse events occur that appear to have a causal relationship with the investigational drug. The injection site (deltoid or gluteal) will, in principle, be fixed at the fourth injection and thereafter, but injection in the deltoid or gluteal muscle can be alternated at the discretion of the investigator if considered appropriate for the patient's safety. If repeated injections are administered in either the deltoid or gluteal muscles, then alternating the side of each injection (left or right) is recommended. The choice of injection needle will be determined by the patient's weight and by the injection site. The weight at baseline (Day 1) will be used when choosing needles for injection from Day 1 to Week 21, and the weight at Week 25 will be used when choosing needles for injection at Week 25 and thereafter. Patients weighing less than 200 lb (<90 kg) will receive their deltoid injection with a 1-inch needle (23 G×1""). Patients weighing 200 lb or more (=90 kg), will receive their deltoid injection with a 1.5-inch needle (22 G×1 1/2""). All gluteal injections will be administered with a 1.5-inch needle (22 G×1 1/2""). The sponsor will collect adverse events starting with the signing of the informed consent form until completion of all end-of-study procedures. Adverse events will be followed by the investigator until it recovers or is considered clinically stable. Adverse events include any occurrence that is new in onset or aggravated in severity or frequency from the baseline condition, or abnormal results of diagnostic procedures, including laboratory test abnormalities. Blood samples (preferably fasted), for serum chemistry and hematology and a random urine sample for urinalysis, electrocardiogram (ECG), vital signs, height, weight, waist circumference, Body Mass Index (BMI), Drug-Induced Extrapyramidal Symptoms Scale (DIEPSS), Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS), evaluation of the injection site and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for patient's assessment of injection pain will be also collected for safety evaluation. PANSS total score and CGI-S score will be collected for efficacy evaluation. Samples for pharmacokinetic evaluation will be collected at designated timepoints. An optional 10-mL pharmacogenomic blood sample will be collected from patients who provide a separate written informed consent for this part of the study. The patients will receive paliperidone palmitate intramuscular (im) as an initial loading dose of 150 mg eq. on treatment Day 1 and 100 mg eq. 1 week later in the deltoid muscle. The study drug will be administered in a flexible dose range of 25 to 150 mg eq. at 4-week intervals from Week 5 as either deltoid or gluteal muscle injections for a total of 11 injections.

2	Magnetic Seizure Therapy for Schizophrenia, Magnetic seizure therapy (MST) is likely to be an alternative options to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).||Widespread stimulation of cortical and subcortical regions is inevitable for ECT since the substantial impedance of the scalp and skull shuts most of the electrical stimulus away from the brain. Nevertheless, magnetic pulses are capable to focus the stimulus to a specific area of the brain because they can pass the scalp and skull without resistance. In Addition, electric current will penetrate into deeper structures, while magnetic stimulus are only capable to reach a depth of a few centimeters. As a consequence, MST are able to generate focus stimuli on superficial regions of the cortex while ECT can't, which may give MST the capability to produce comparable therapeutic benefits with the absence of apparent cognitive side effects., magnetic seizure therapy|randomized controlled trials|schizophrenia|cognition

0	The Effect of Acupuncture on Pre-operative Anxiety Levels in Neurosurgical Patients: a Randomised, Controlled Trail, Methodology All patients presenting for neurosurgery will be considered and the study will take place on the Theatre Admissions Units at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield, United Kingdom. After gaining consent, baseline anxiety levels will be assessed using the APAIS and STAI questionnaires. The subject will then be randomised using a web-based programme to one of two groups: intervention (Yintang point), or control (no intervention). All the acupuncture will done with the same type of needle and by the same investigator. The questionnaires will be repeated 30 minutes later to assess the effect of the intervention.|Design: type of study design and justification The study is a randomised control trial looking at an acupuncture point utilised for anxiety reduction (Yintang), and a controls. The ratio of intervention to controls is 1:1. After advice for experts in acupuncture, the investigators are not including a placebo acupuncture intervention or sham acupuncture. This is because it is increasingly recognised that any form of acupuncture or acupressure can have central effects and that sham acupuncture is actually impossible to undertake. Pilot study data (awaiting publication) done in the investigator's institution demonstrated a mean (standard deviation) STAI score in neurosurgical patients of 8.86 (4.4). Previous data have suggested that acupuncture may reduce anxiety levels by 25-37%. Assuming a p< 0.05 and power 0.9, in order to demonstrate a 30% reduction in STAI scores, the investigators will need 58 patients in each group. Assuming a 10% dropout rate, the investigators aim to recruit 64 patients in each group (128 in total). The investigators have shown that anxiety levels are not related to gender or site of surgery (cranial vs. spinal) and therefore will not stratify the groups. The investigators will undertake block randomisation to try and minimise any learning effects by the acupuncturist.|Analysis including statistical methods, where appropriate The investigators will use analysis of variance (ANOVA) to analyse anxiety scores from the two questionnaires (after testing for normality of data distribution). Pain scores will be analysed by t-tests and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) incidence by Chi-squared., 0

We will hold information campaigns to encourage referrals once the clinical trial procedure is set. Patients will be assessed for eligibility based on the criteria detailed below. Written informed consent will be obtained from eligible subjects or the subjects' parents if they are younger than the age of 18 years. Baseline clinical and neuropsychological assessments will be done at first. Patients will receive a single dose of memantine 5 mg to test if any allergic reactions to those who have never used it before. And then they will be randomized into 3 groups: the first group receives a target dose of memantine 10 mg/day, the second group receives a target dose of memantine 20 mg/day, and the third is a placebo control group. Both the participants and the clinicians are blinded to the agents and dosage they are taking. The dose titrating schedule for medication groups will be 5 mg/day for the first week with an increment of 5 mg per week to reach their designated targeted dose. So the10 mg add-on group will reach their target dose by the beginning of the second week and the 20 mg/day add-on group will reach their target dose by the beginning of the fourth week.

By the end of the 12-week trial, they will receive all clinical and neuropsychological assessments again.||To use the least resources and to make most use of the information, as well as take into account of attrition, we plan to recruit 40 patients for each group with a total of 120 participants., adjuvant therapy|cognitive deficits|first episode schizophrenia|glutamate hypothesis|memantine|negative symptoms
0	Is Auriculotherapy Responsible for Improvements on Anxiety Students' Prior and After Examinations?, To treat anxiety, conventional medicine relies on medicines such as benzodiazepines, antidepressants, barbiturates, and antihistamines. However, several authors have reported western medicine cannot resolve all anxiety diseases and the risk of side effects, resistance to pharmacological treatments affects approximately one in three patients with anxiety disorders.||Alternatively, auriculotherapy is a technique similar to reflexology. It is speculated the technique might work in anxiety because groups of pluripotent cells contain information from the whole organism creating regional organization centres representing different parts of the body, through the recruitment of more cortex cells dedicated to specific body areas. Thus reflex points in the ear can incite body responses by the stimulation of reticular formation and the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. The information that comes from the thermal, Algic and proprioceptive stimuli are transmitted from the auricular pavilion by the fibres of the nerves: trigeminal; Auricular magnum and minor occipital (sensitive branch of the cervical plexus) and the vagus nerve. The vagus nerve is responsible for the parasympathetic innervation of the lung, heart, stomach, and small intestine, as well as the pharynx and larynx muscles and it also sends information to important brain regions (e.g., locus coeruleus, orbitofrontal cortex, hippocampus and at amygdala) in the regulation of anxiety. In turn, the trigeminal nerve controls, mainly, the mastication muscles and the facial sensitivity while the cervical plexus nerve is responsible for neck muscles, diaphragm, and thorax., Anxiety|Vagus nerve stimulation|auriculotherapy|students
0	MDMA-Assisted Psychotherapy for Anxiety Associated With a Life-Threatening Illness, Individuals facing, or who have faced, a life-threatening illness contend with more than just the physical symptoms of their condition and may experience anxiety, depression, anger, and despair that can exacerbate their distress. Research suggests that diagnosis of, and living with a life-threatening illness can result in symptoms similar to those seen in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).||3,-4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is a monoamine releaser with a unique pharmacological profile that include decreased feelings of fear, increased positive mood and increased interpersonal trust. Findings from clinical trials in people with PTSD and anecdotal reports suggest that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy may assist people who have anxiety related to having a life-threatening illness.||This Phase 2 pilot study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 18 participants comparing the effects of MDMA-assisted therapy vs. placebo with therapy. Thirteen participants were randomized to the active dose condition of 125 mg of MDMA (plus an optional supplemental dose of 62.5 mg MDMA) with therapy and five participants were randomized to the placebo with therapy condition. The study will consist of two blinded experimental sessions of MDMA-assisted therapy or placebo with therapy, each session lasting six to eight hours and scheduled two to four weeks apart. Each participant will be unblinded one month after their second experimental session in Stage 1. After unblinding, participants receiving MDMA will complete a third open-label experimental session of MDMA-assisted therapy and participants who originally received placebo will have the opportunity to cross over to open-label Stage 2 and receive active MDMA-assisted therapy in 3 sessions.||The primary objective of the study is to assess changes in trait anxiety in subjects receiving active dose MDMA compared to those receiving placebo as measured by State-Trait Anxiety Index (STAI) Trait scores from Baseline to the Primary Endpoint (one month after the second experimental session)., Anxiety|MDMA|Life-threatening illness|Therapy

2	Tryptophan MRI in People With Schizophrenia and Healthy Controls, There is emerging evidence to suggest that disturbances in the kynurenine pathway may be related to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Several post-mortem studies have documented specific abnormalities in the kynurenine pathway, including increased levels of kynurenine and kynurenic acid (KYNA) in the prefrontal cortex of people with schizophrenia (1-4). Increased levels of kynurenine and KYNA have also been observed in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) of people with this illness (5). In addition, post-mortem studies have documented changes in key enzymes, including increased expression of tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (2, 6) (TDO), which converts tryptophan to kynurenine, and reduced activity of kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO) (4), which may shift metabolism towards enhanced KYNA formation. Finally, a number of genetic studies have implicated the KYNA pathway in this disease. Wonodi et al. (7) found decreased KMO gene expression in the frontal eye field of people with schizophrenia, and Holtze et al. (8) recently reported an association between a KMO SNP and CSF levels of KYNA. Notably, although the exact mechanism underlying the KP impairment in people with schizophrenia is unknown, immune and stress mechanisms have been implicated (7,9).||Increased KYNA may have a number of adverse consequences of importance in schizophrenia. In particular, KYNA is an antagonist of the α7 nicotinic and NMDA glutamate receptors. Dysfunctions of these receptors have been linked to the cognitive impairments and symptom manifestations observed in people with schizophrenia. The purpose of the proposed project is to examine the impact of increased brain KYNA on performance of cognitive tasks and related neuroimaging measures in people with DSM-5/DSM-IV-TR schizophrenia, schizophreniform, or schizoaffective disorder patients and healthy controls. In addition, the investigators will secondarily investigate the relationship of peripheral inflammatory markers and glucocorticoid levels as part of the HPA stress axis to examine relationships and shift to a Type 2 immune response in schizophrenia. Using tryptophan loading to increase KYNA levels, the study will test the hypothesis, based on complementary preliminary studies in rodents, that disease-related cognitive deficits in people with schizophrenia are preferentially susceptible to (further) elevations in KYNA levels.||The investigators hypothesize that tryptophan-induced elevations in brain KYNA levels will: 1) acutely impair performance on measures of verbal and visual memory, attention, working memory, and processing speed in people with schizophrenia; 2) alter dorsolateral-hippocampal activation and connectivity, which underlies the performance of the relational memory task; and 3) decrease mPFC MRS measures of glutamate, consistent with preclinical microdialysis data. In an exploratory framework, the investigators hypothesize that increased brain KYNA levels alter default network activation and connectivity, an effect which may be mediated by the action of KYNA on α7 nicotinic and/or NMDA receptors. The investigators will also investigate the extent to which cytokine and HPA axis peripheral measures are related to the effect of tryptophan-induced elevated KYNA levels on cognitive performance and fMRI and MRS measures. Comparisons with results from healthy controls will determine if participants with schizophrenia have an aberrant or exaggerated response to increased KYNA levels.||Funding Information:||Funded by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)||Grant Number- 1P50MH103222-01||Principal Investigator- Robert Schwarcz, PhD||Project Title- Kynurenic Acid and Cognitive Abnormalities in Schizophrenia||Program Officer Full Name- Steven Zalcamn||External Org# Name- University of Maryland, Baltimore, tryptophan|kynurenic acid|schizophrenia

0	EFFECTS OF REPEATED GENERAL ANAESTHESIA ON THE LEVEL OF PRE-PROCEDURE ANXIETY IN CHILDREN UNDERGOING RADIOTHERAPY., Radiotherapy procedures are used to damage or destroy growing cancer cells.(1) This strategic use of ionized radiation is being practiced since the early 20th century and is very effective in destroying diseased cancer cells while sparing the healthy ones.(2) These procedures require patients to stay absolutely still, hence requiring general anesthesia in case of children compared to the adults. The treatment also requires multiple cycles of radiotherapy for which children have to undergo general anaesthesia multiple times.(3) Multiple anaesthetics for the same child may lead to preoperative anxiety, increased autonomic fluctuations, increased demand for anaesthetics and nausea/vomiting.(4-5) Pre-operative anxiety not only causes physical but also emotional and psychological trauma.(6) Such patients, subjected to anxiety, may face fear and potential hesitance in visiting the pre-anesthesia clinics for evaluation, induction and problems in pre-operative and recovery span.(7-8)It is therefore important to gauge the extent of this anxiety and to see whether it increases or decreases with subsequent cycles of treatment .Unless this is identified it will be difficult to put appropriate treatments in place.||Though previous studies are available on pre-operative anxiety in children but there has been little research about level of a child's anxiety under going repeated general anesthesia, especially during radiotherapy sessions. We were unable to identify any study on the subject in our literature search, a gap that needs research.||Several scales are available to evaluate anxiety in children(9), mYPAS scale is a standard It is also important to measure the anxiety levels of the parents accompanying the child, since this may have an effect on behavior., 0
2	The Effect of Psychoeducation on Healthy Lifestyle Behaviors in Individuals With Schizophrenia, This study is conducted in pretest-posttest randomized controlled experimental research type in a Community Mental Health Center in the south of Turkey. The population of the study are the individuals with schizophrenia who registered in a Community Mental Health Center and are under observation (N=230). The sample number is determined based on another similar study with power analysis. In the evaluation completed according to the healthy lifestyle behaviours score, the sample number needed to participate in the study was determined to be at least 42 (intervention group=21 - control group=21) in order for research results to have a meaningful effect.In order to reduce the selection bias in the determination of intervention and control groups, intervention and control groups were formed with a third person who did not have a direct role in the research from 1 to 82 using simple random sampling method. The data were collected from 82 individuals with schizophrenia, as 41 intervention and 41 control groups. The individuals with schizophrenia in the study and their families were informed according to the Helsinki Declaration and written and verbal approval were collected. The behavioural change identification form was applied to individuals with schizophrenia, who agreed to participate in the study, and their stage of the Transtheoretical Model was detected. The participants meeting the criteria in the participation stage (contemplation, preparation, action) were assigned to the intervention and control groups with the randomization. Pretests (personal information form, behavioural change identification form, Healthy Lifestyle Behaviours Scale II) were applied to the intervention and control groups before the psychoeducation. In addition to the rehabilitation activities conducted in the Community Mental Health Center, healthy lifestyle behaviours psychoeducation programme, based on the Transtheoretical Model, with 6 sessions (healthcare responsibility, nutrition, physical activity, spiritual development, interpersonal relationships, stress management) was applied to the intervention group for 6 weeks as three days in the weekdays and two sessions in a day. Psychoeducation was carried out by the researcher on the same day but within different time zones. Each psychoeducation session took 90-120 minutes with the breaks taken considering the participants' mood. After completing six sessions, the behavioural change identification form and Healthy Lifestyle Behaviours Scale II were applied to the intervention group again. On the other hand, the control group continued their rehabilitation practices prepared for themselves in the Community Mental Health Center. It was contacted with the control group three times, two face to face and one via phone. In the third and final meeting, when the intervention group's sessions are completed, the behavioural change identification form and Healthy Lifestyle Behaviours Scale II were applied again to the control group. All the participants remained in the study at the end of it. The study was completed with 41 individuals in the intervention group and 41 individuals in the control group. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences v23.0, which is a statistical analysis programme, was used to evaluate the findings of the study. It was benefited from descriptive statistics such as frequency, percentage, arithmetic average, standard deviation, minimum and maximum during data analysis. Parametric tests were used for the data analysis. The chi-squared test was used for relation analysis of two different categorized variables whereas the t-test was used while comparing averages of two independent groups. To determine the alteration of individuals' behavioural change stages before and after receiving psychoeducation, the McNemar test was used. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) while detecting the effect of the intervention study in the researches designed in the entrepreneurial pattern. In ANCOVA, to detect how big the effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable the eta squared (effect size) was calculated and the eta squared value (η2) was interpreted that it presents which parts of the change explain the total variant that the independent variable has on the dependent variable and it received a value. Eta squared is interpreted as 0,01 as the minor effect, 0,06 as medium effect and 0,14 as large effect.

2	A Neurofeedback Intervention to Improve Working Memory in Schizophrenia, Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a chronic debilitating mental disorder that affects 2.4 million Americans and leads to considerable individual and societal costs. In patients with SCZ, cognitive deficits (CD) occur early in the course of the illness, are associated with more severe illness, and are the best predictor of functional outcomes. Nonetheless, to date, CD have been difficult to treat using available treatments. Recent studies suggest CD in patients with SCZ may arise from abnormal synchronization of distributed neural networks. Synchronization or synchronous firing of neurons, binds cortical areas into functional networks in a task and state-dependent manner. Thus novel therapies that improve abnormal neural synchrony may improve previously refractory symptoms arising from disordered brain networks.||Neural synchrony or coherence in the gamma band (GBR, 30-45Hz) plays a central role in top-down attention, multisensory processing, perceptual binding and working memory (WM). Patients with SCZ exhibit abnormal GBR, and the magnitude of impairment is associated with the severity of cognitive disorganization. Given these results, improving GBR should improve CD, including WM in SCZ. This hypothesis has been tested and confirmed using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Additionally, EEG-based neurofeedback (NFB) is hypothesized to improve GBR and cognitive function in patients with SCZ. NFB is a low-cost, easily administered and well-tolerated treatment. In healthy controls, Gamma-NFB improves GBR and cognitive function including WM. Thus, the investigators propose testing the feasibility and effectiveness of improving GBR using gamma-NFB in patients with SCZ using the framework of the R61/R33 mechanism.||The first trial (R61) is a proof-of-concept study designed to assess target engagement and dose response curve. Thirty SCZ patients will receive G-NFB training for 12 weeks (2 weekly sessions of 30minute duration) and be assessed for 1) evidence of training, 2) Change in GBR, 3) Change in WM and 4) Change in community functioning. The second trial (R33) aims to confirm target engagement based on training parameters obtained from R61, and to assess whether G-NFB is superior to an active-placebo neurofeedback intervention in improving GBR, WM and community functioning., Neurofeedback, Gamma band response

0	A Clinical Trial of a Hemp-Derived Cannabidiol Product for Anxiety, This investigation will be the first of its kind to conduct a clinical trial of an industrial hemp-derived product in individuals with anxiety. Despite the recent interest in medical cannabis and cannabinoid-based products, the availability of hemp-derived products in all 50 states, and anecdotal evidence suggesting that hemp-derived products may have a profound anxiolytic effect, no studies have conducted a clinical trial of a hemp-derived product in individuals who suffer from anxiety.||This investigation is composed of two phases. Phase 1 is comprised of a six-week open-label clinical trial of the custom formulated hemp-derived high-CBD solution in individuals with anxiety. Participants will be pre-screened by phone in order to evaluate their eligibility for the study. If approved, participants will come to the hospital for a baseline/screening visit, and will complete a structured clinical interview, clinical and quality of life questionnaires, and cognitive assessments. Enrolled participants will be given study product to use for the duration of the study; participants will be instructed to self-administer the solution under the tongue twice daily for six weeks. Throughout the treatment period, participants will complete short in-person or phone visits on a weekly basis, where they will complete questionnaires about their mood and quality of life. Participants will also return to the hospital for a final visit after six weeks of treatment to complete additional questionnaires and cognitive assessments.||Phase 2 of the study is a double-blind clinical trial of this solution in patients with anxiety. This double-blind trial will begin after the open-label trial has been completed. In the same manner as the open-label trial, participants will be pre-screened by phone, and approved participants will come to the hospital for a baseline/screening visit to complete a structured clinical interview, questionnaires, and cognitive assessments. Eligible participants will also have the option to complete an hour-long MRI scan at the baseline and final visits. Enrolled participants will receive either CBD solution or placebo solution to self-administer throughout the six week treatment period, as described above. Participants will complete in-person visits and phone check-ins during the treatment period to complete questionnaires about their mood and quality of life. Participants in this phase of the study will also return for a final visit after six weeks of treatment to complete additional questionnaires, cognitive assessments, and an optional MRI scan., 0
2	Early Predictors of Poor Treatment Response in Patients With Schizophrenia Treated With Atypical Antipsychotics, Study Design: This study recruited hospitalized adult patients who had a relapse of schizophrenia. All participants had received antipsychotic treatment for a period of time previously. They have to meet the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV). One hundred and twenty adult inpatients were recruited and were randomly assigned to receive olanzapine (n=60), risperidone (n=30) and paliperidone (n=30) in an allocation ratio of 2:1:1. The participants were allowed to change the dosage of antipsychotics and their hospitalization status according to the judgement of in-charged physicians during the study period.||The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board and written informed consents were obtained either directly from the patients or from their legal guardians after the study had been explained. The inclusion criteria for this study were: (1) age 18 to 65 years, (2) no major systemic illnesses based on physical examinations and laboratory test results, and (3) baseline PANSS total score≧60. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) participants not taking any antipsychotics in the previous one month, (2) participants were pregnant and lactating women, and (3) history of clozapine treatment in the previous 3 months, and (4) patients receiving long-acting antipsychotic injections in the preceding 6 months of enrollment.||This study was conducted by a 12-week, open-label and naturalistic randomized design. A tri-therapy (olanzapine, risperidone, and paliperidone) completely randomized design was adopted for this study, which involved three homogeneous groups of patients with a run-in period of 3 months. The patients were required to have discontinued all prior use of antipsychotics for a period of at least 7 days before their entry into the study. During wash-out period, administration of either oral benzodiazpines, hypnotics or injection of lorazepam to control anxiety, insomnia and aggression were allowed. After the wash-out period, the patients received treatment with an atypical antipsychotic drug, olanzapine, risperidone or paliperidone for 3 months.||The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) rating scale was used to evaluate the changes of psychiatric symptoms in each time point. The subject patients were interviewed for the PANSS by senior psychiatrists. The raters in the present study had worked mainly on inpatient treatment of severe schizophrenic patients, and were well acquainted with symptoms of schizophrenia. Prior to the present study, all participating psychiatrists had received adequate training through the manual and they had had clinical experience in the PANSS rating before the study. At each time point if the scores of PANSS showed the patient's symptoms had worsened, the dosage would be adjusted based on the clinical judgment of in-charged senior psychiatrist. However, if the scores of PANSS were improved, the dosage was maintained. The recommended dose for the three groups were as follows: 10 to 20 mg daily for olanzapine, 4 to 6 mg daily for risperidone, and 6 to 12 mg daily for paliperidone. Throughout the study period, the paticipants were allowed to continuously use some concomitant medication, including lorazepam (up to 6 mg/day) for insomnia or agitation and biperiden (up to 6 mg/day) for treatment of extrapyramidal side effects. No other psychotropic agents were administered during the 12-week study., schizophrenia|PANSS|positive predictive value|negative predictive value
2	A Trial of Folate With B12 in Patients With Schizophrenia With Residual Symptoms in Ethiopia, This is a 16-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of Folate 2mg plus B12 400mcg, as an adjunctive therapy in approximately 240 consecutive outpatients with schizophrenia from Amanuel Hospital, which is based at Addis Ababa, Ethiopia will be enrolled and screened for eligibility. The goal is to randomize and complete 200 subjects from the 240 enrolled. A Sequential Parallel Design for Double-Blind Phase will be utilized. During the first phase of double-blind adjunctive treatment, eligible patients (n=200) are randomized to adjunctive treatment with either folate and vitamin B12 (n=60) or placebo (n=150), with a 2:3:3 ratio for random assignment to the treatment sequences drug/drug (DD; n=70), placebo/placebo (PP; n=70), and placebo/drug (PD; n=75), while all continue to receive their antipsychotic agent for the entire duration of the study. Assuming a 10% drop-out rate during the first phase, 126 patients on placebo will complete the first 56-day phase, and 54 patients on folate and vitamin B12 will complete the first 56-day phase., 0
2	The Efficacy of Escitalopram for Negative Symptoms in Schizophrenia, The aim of this study is to evaluate the therapeutic effect of escitalopram (cipralex) in the treatment of negative symptoms in schizophrenic patients receiving either typical or the newer atypical antipsychotics (olanzapine and risperidone) in a double-blind placebo-controlled study. As there is no drug treatment that is considered as first-line treatment in the treatment of negative symptoms, we thought that the comparison with placebo is plausible. However, it is important to note that the patients will receive the commonly used treatment for their disorder (i.e. antipsychotic medication)., negative symptoms|depression|ssri|schizophrenia
2	Effectiveness of Vitamin Supplementation in Treating People With Residual Symptoms of Schizophrenia, About 30% of people with schizophrenia suffer from treatment-resistant psychotic symptoms, which may include social withdrawal, apathy, and depression. These negative symptoms can produce substantial distress for those affected, often disrupting social and occupational functioning and resulting in hospitalization. Although atypical antipsychotic medications have demonstrated some success in treating negative symptoms, the degree to which many negative symptoms respond is unclear. Depression and poor response to antidepressant medication have been linked to deficiency in the vitamins folate and B12. It is believed that vitamin supplementation with folate and B12 may offer a safe and inexpensive approach to improve outcomes for people with schizophrenia who have residual negative symptoms and have exhibited poor treatment response. This study will compare the effectiveness of folate and B12 versus placebo in reducing negative symptoms in people with schizophrenia.||Participation in this double-blind study will last 19 weeks. Potential participants will undergo initial screening, which will include a medical and psychiatric evaluation, physical exam, blood draw, urine sampling, and questionnaires. Participants will also be asked for permission to use a portion of the blood sample for genetic analysis. Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to take folate with B12 or placebo. Participants will first complete a 2-week stabilization phase, followed by the 16-week treatment study. Medication visits, occurring every 2 weeks during treatment, will include questions about medication side effects and the distribution of study medication. During specified medication visits, participants will complete various assessments, which will include questionnaires about schizophrenia, tests of learning and memory, repeat blood tests, and pregnancy tests. The medication visits will last between 15 minutes and 4 hours, depending on the scheduled assessments for that visit., Cognition|Folic Acid|B12
2	Treating Thought Problems in Patients With Schizophrenia, Many schizophrenia patients have serious difficulties that affect their quality of life. Cognitive Adaptation Training (CAT) may improve adaptive functioning, quality of life, and rates of relapse in schizophrenia patients. CAT, which involves compensatory strategies or environmental supports, is tailored to each individual and is based on executive functioning levels and other factors.||Participants are randomly assigned to CAT, Minimal Environmental Supports (MES), or treatment as usual for 2 years. Participants receiving CAT will have a trained therapist make weekly visits to their home for 9 months. Over the following 3 months, the frequency of CAT visits will be slowly reduced to once a month. For the remaining 12 months of treatment, patients receive CAT only once a month.||Participants assigned to the MES group receive a generic set of supplies and equipment (calendar, alarm clock, watch, bus passes, etc.) at the beginning of the 2-year period. Each month, the supplies are replenished as necessary during the patient's scheduled clinic visit.||In all groups, assessments of adaptive function and quality of life occur at study start and at 3, 6, 9, 18, and 24 months., 0

2	Sertindole in Asian Patients With Schizophrenia, This study is the first randomised clinical trial performed in Asia with sertindole, aiming at comparing sertindole efficacy and safety to that of another atypical antipsychotic.||Sertindole is a limbic-selective antipsychotic agent with a unique neuropharmacological profile. Sertindole has shown significant improvements relative to placebo against both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia (measured by PANSS total, PANSS negative and positive subscale scores). It is well tolerated and shows placebo-level incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). Sertindole is associated with a dose-dependent increase in the QT interval, but this does not translate into an excess mortality with sertindole relative to that of other recently developed antipsychotics in their respective clinical development programmes., 0
2	Cognitive Remediation Therapy in Schizophrenia: Effects on BDNF Levels, Forty patients with schizophrenia disorder and twenty healthy volunteers will be recruited. Patients will be randomly allocated either the experimental group, undergoing an individual CRT for 40 hours during 16 weeks, or the control group following a psycho-educational intervention without any neurocognitive work, both lasting the same amount of hours and period of time. Blood samples will be obtained from participants in four moments: before treatment, at week 4, at week 16, and at 32 week follow-up. In addition, repeated measurements will be obtained with a neurocognitive battery based on the MATRICS consensus battery and the Positive And Negative Syndromes Scale (PANSS). Assessments will be conducted by trained personnel who will remain blind to the group assignment. A factorial model will be performed conducting a repeated measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to study the effects of CRT on the levels of BDNF, neurocognition, symptoms and social functioning, adding the necessary co-variants. Finally, a linear regression model to determine the predictive role of serum levels of BDNF and data from functional and structural neuroimaging on the effects of CRT will be performed., Schizophrenia|Cognitive Remediation|BDNF
2	Motivation and Executive Control in Schizophrenia, behavioral protocol. Letters (vowel and consonant; upper- or lower- case) are presented in several colours into successive blocks. Each block included a series of eight letters. Each colour required a specific task given by a fixed rule (contextual control) but for some colour, the rule changes sometimes (episodic control). Participants are informed that payoffs vary according to their own performance. A frame indicates essay with bonus reward. Moreover a dashed frame indicates a low-bonus reward and a solid frame means a high-bonus reward. Thus different blocks are designed: low-incentive block and high incentive block.||This reward increased from standard to bonus motivation in high-incentive block (contextual motivation) and from low to high according to the type of blocks (episodic motivation) Reaction time may be higher in bonus reward Patients with schizophrenia are not sensitive to contextual motivation, and therefore patients should behave differently than control in contextual motivation., schizophrenia|motivation|executive control

This study is projected to randomize approximately 435 subjects (18-65 years) to 3 treatment groups (SEP-363856 50 mg/day, SEP-363856 75 mg/day, or placebo) in a 1:1:1 ratio. In addition, the study will randomize approximately 90 adolescent subjects (13-17 years) in a 1:1:1 ratio to the 3 treatment groups (with approximately 30 subjects per group) in a separate cohort. Treatment assignment will be stratified by country. Study drug will be taken once a day and may be taken with or without food.||This study is designed to test the hypothesis that, treatment with SEP-363856 in adult subjects with schizophrenia will result in significantly greater reduction (i.e. improvement) in PANSS total score and CGI-S score at Week 6 from Baseline when compared to placebo. The overall Type I error is controlled for two hierarchical families of hypotheses. The first family includes hypotheses about the testing of change from Baseline in PANSS total score at Week 6 between each of the SEP-363856 dose levels vs. placebo. The second family of hypotheses are about the testing of change from Baseline in CGI-S score at Week 6 between each of the SEP-363856 dose levels vs. placebo., acute psychosis|schizophrenia
2	"A Study on Psychopathological Progress of Early Schizophrenia-Like Disorder (SOPRES), Project No: 1 Title: A Study of Psychopathological Progress of Early Schizophrenia-like Disorder specific aims are 1) To elicit the psychopathology of identified Early Schizophrenia-like Disorder (ESLD) and to categorize into 3 groups of pre-schizotypal, schizotypal, and prodromal ESLD. 2) The reveal the prevalence of different neurobiological impairment (studied in Project No.2) in 3 groups of these identified ESLD subjects. 3) The stability of psychopathology of 3 groups of identified ESLD. 4) The process of conversion and conversion rates of psychotic state from non-psychotic state in a 2-year follow-up||Study procedures:||Recruitment:||The high-risk group of schizophrenia will be recruited by referral from psychiatric outpatient clinics in Northern Taiwan, referral from school counseling room in Taipei City and Taipei County, and subjects with known family history from our previous schizophrenia genetic study, which has a size of 850 families. As we have good collaborative works with several psychiatric hospitals and psychiatric departments of general hospitals, it is expected that 100 subjects could be assessed from the outpatient referral. The increasing needs of psychiatric consultation from school system give us a chance to recruit 50 subjects by school referral (school counseling system). Our previous family genetic studies in schizophrenia have already recruited 850 families. As the relatively risk of schizophrenic spectrum disorders (schizophrenia and schizotypal disorder) is much higher in families with schizophrenic patients, and in our experiences the families of schizophrenic patients often expressed worries about developing the illness themselves, it is expected that 100 subjects could be assessed from this population.||The school surveillance will be conducted in three selected senior high schools and three colleges in Taipei metropolitan aiming at subjects fitting our recruiting indicators, including cognitive decline, affective symptoms, social isolation, and school failure (CASIS). A pilot study will be conducted in initial 5-10 nominated candidate students to cross check the validity and applicability of each screening methods. There are 75,084 senior high school students in Academic Year 2003-2004 in Taipei City. We plan to survey the teachers of 3000 students to from 3 senior high schools (around 1000 students each), representing schools with highly-academic-, vocational-, and mixed-orientation. Another 3000 students will be recruited from 3 colleges by administering freshman self-report questionnaire. It is expected that 100 subjects could be identified as subjects with early schizophrenia-like clinical presentations.||The general public will be recruited by respondents to our study ads co-sponsored by the Mental Health Foundation (MHF) framed in terms of highlighting awareness of early cognitive deficits and prevention from severe mental disorders (Caring Brain and Worry Free Program). As the PI had recruited subjects for ""brain bank"" by public advocacy and the Mental Health Foundation already had annual surveys regarding the general public's mental health conditions and subjective well-being with good response rate and the results have been broadcast on major media. Based on the highly expected credit of the MHF, we expect to identify and recruit 50 subjects from this channel.||The normal control will be recruited from the subjects' schoolmates or friends not meeting our recruitment criteria, matched by age, gender, and education. We need 200 normal control subjects based on a two to one ration between the study subject and the normal control.||Referral criteria:||Outpatient group: suspected ""latent"" or ""beginning of"" schizophrenia based on psychiatrists' clinical experiences; school referral group: problematic students unable to be explained by common conduct problems or psychosocial issues from teachers' perspectives (un-understandable emotional, behavioral, interpersonal, or academic problems); family study group: siblings or offspring of schizophrenic patients exhibiting symptoms or behavioral patterns warrant family's attention (something reminding them about their schizophrenic relatives).||3) Recruitment criteria: (CASIS) Cognitive deficits: subjectively poor concentration; decline of intelligence; inefficient learning; rigid thinking; Affective symptoms: unexplainable depressiveness, anxiousness, fearfulness, obsession, or hypochondriacal ideas; social isolation: having less than two close friends; generally withdrew, distant, aloof, or isolated; frequent absence without identifiable causes; school failure: markedly deterioration of academic performance or quitting school.||Subjects presenting at least two of the above conditions (one of cognitive deficit and at least one of the remaining three) will be screened for psychotic-prone symptoms by the Latent Schizophrenia Screening Sheet (LSSS) (necessary to have cognitive deficit) of 26 items (6 dimensions) including thoughts, perceptions, inappropriate behaviors, affective symptoms, interpersonal relationship, and neurotic symptoms. Subjects respond ""sure"" for any item of the LSS will be recruited for further assessments.||Anticipated Results: The cross-sectional and longitudinal progress of psychopathology of ESLD will be revealed. The comprehensiveness and the domains of psychopathology of ESLD will be elicited. The progressing process of the psychopathological domains will be characterized.||The validity of subgrouping of ESLD into pre-schizotypal, schizotypal and prodromal types will be determined.|We'll reveal the pattern of aggravation of symptomatic level as time goes by: more subjects progress to the severer level during the 2-year follow-up (i.e., from pre-schizotypy to schizotypy, from prodrome to SCH, etc; few subjects could ""drift back"" to the milder symptomatic level (i.e., from prodrome to schizotypy or from schizotypy to pre-schizotypy, etc).|To determine some specific items in the screening tools, i.e., LSS, SOPS, for better positive predictive values than the others.|The sensitivity and specificity of the screening tools will be examined using neurobiological indicators (Project No.2) by constrast validity testing.||Project No: 2 Title: Neurobiological Study of Early Schizophrenia-like Disorder (ESLD) Specific Aims: Based on the neurodevelopmental hypothesis of schizophrenia (SCH), it is assumed that clinically identified pre-psychotic state of SCH, termed as Early Schizophrenia-like Disorder (ESLD)(Project No.1), may have impaired neurobiological functions. Our previous family-based studies also supported that some neurobiological markers, such as sustained attention deficits, were potential endophenotypes of schizophrenia (see background below). Therefore, in Project No.2 of the Study on Psychopathological Progress of ESLD (SOPRES) Program, we plan to adopt multi-level approaches to investigate the potential neurobiological changes in patients with ESLD. The approaches include certain specific neuropsychological, neurophysiological and neuroimaging measurements.||The specific aims of neuropsychological study are as follows: 1) to examine whether individuals with ESLD evidence controlled processing dysfunction of neurocognition; 2) if true, to further explore whether such dysfunction involving neurocognitive domain is simplex or multiplex in nature; 3) to determine whether neurocognitive controlled processing measure(s) used in the present study can be a useful screening tool for ESLD and further for early detection of schizophrenia.||The specific aims of the other dimensions of neurobiological studies are:||To clarify the prevalence of impaired flush response to Niacin skin patch in ESLD and to assess the predictive validity of Niacin skin test in the progression of schizophrenia;|To reveal the prevalence of two brain inhibitory functions (i.e. prepulse inhibition of startle (PPI) and P50 event-related potential (ERP) suppression) in ESLD and the change along clinical course of those ESLD subjects;|To measure the regional changes of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in hippocampus and frontal lobe in subjects with ESLD, and define the predictive validity in the follow-up course.|To measure the connectivity and diffusion anisotropy between the hippocampus and frontal lobe by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in subjects with ESLD, and define the predictive validity in the follow-up course.|To evaluate the possibility of skin niacin response/MRS/DTI/P50/PPI as endophenotypes in further genetic research of schizophrenia.||The importance of the specific inhibitory measures also resides in the fact that they are understood at neurobiological (and in some cases, molecular) levels, based on extensive human and animal model studies.||P50 Suppression:||P50 suppression is an important endophenotype of schizophrenia. P50 suppression occurs when two clicks are presented with a 500 msec interstimulus interval. The impaired suppression of the P50 to the second stimulus has been reported in a number of studies in chronic schizophrenia patients, both medicated and unmedicated, first-episode patients, and first-degree relatives of schizophrenics, as well as schizotypal individuals.||Impaired P50 suppression is extensively studied using anatomical and molecular genetic and other neurobiological studies. These findings support that P50 suppression impairment is a possible endophenotype of information processing deficits in schizophrenia.||Prepulse inhibition (PPI):||PPI of the startle response is an operational measure of preattentive sensorimotor gating. The term startle modification refers to the changes in the startle reflex, induced by various stimulus modalities, when the startle-eliciting stimulus is preceeded by a (usually weak) stimulus called a prepulse. It is stable over time in both normal subjects and schizophrenia patients.||Deficits in PPI have been consistently identified in schizophrenia, and PPI is an excellent candidate endophenotype in schizophrenia since PPI deficits occurred in schizophrenia patients, and schizotypal personality disorder patients.||To study the presence and change of impaired PPI and P50 suppression in ESLD may help us clarify the stability of the impairment along the disease course and the validity of using the PPI and P50 test as a screening tool for pre-psychotic state of schizophrenia.||Project No: 3 Title: Family Genetic Study of Early Schizophrenia-like Disorder I. Specific Aims: Genetic high-risk (HR) approach, in which subjects with one or more affected relatives were recruited since infancy or early childhood, has been the most commonly adopted one to address the early detection of schizophrenia (1). However, as pointed out in a recent review (2), there are two major limitations of these studies. First, because the majority of these genetic high-risk studies were started 30-40 years ago, many of them used methods that are outdated and sometimes focused on less relevant subjects in their assessments. Second, only approximately 10% of the HR children develop schizophrenia, making the predictions concerning vulnerability indicators unprecise. Recently an alternative approach called clinical high-risk or ultra-high-risk has been advocated, in which adolescents or young adults referred for mental health evaluation with attenuated psychotic symptoms or behavioral problems commonly observed in the HR children were recruited for prospective follow-ups (3, 4). In this PPG, we propose an approach that combines both genetic HR and clinical HR to enrich the recruitment of subjects at increased risk of developing early schizophrenia-like disorder (ESLD).||Moreover, the interpretation of the contrast between HR subjects and normal controls or between HR with onset of schizophrenia and HR without onset of schizophrenia tends not to be straightforward. Any neurodevelopmental disturbances can be distributed in two independent dimensions: a genetic-environmental causal continuum and an early-to-late maturation expression continuum (5). A factor that is present in an HR subject but absent in normal controls is not necessarily of genetic origin. One way to distinguish is to examine whether a similar deficit is present in other non-HR sibling of the HR proband. However, previous HR studies tended to measure only the HR subject in each family.||In this component project, we propose to adopt a family-genetic approach to provide more information for the interpretation of the contrast between HR of different severity and normal controls or between HR with progression to a more severe stage and HR without such progression. The specific aims of this component project are as follows:||Aim 1:To assess to what extent the psychopathological features identified in the probands of pre-schizotypal ESLD, schizotypal ESLD, prodromal ESLD, or early schizophrenia are also present in their first-degree relatives.||Aim 2: To assess to what extent the neurodevelopmental or neurobiological impairment identified in the probands of pre-schizotypal ESLD, schizotypal ESLD, prodromal ESLD, or early schizophrenia are also present in their first-degree relatives.||Aim 3: To assess to what extent the conversion in psychotic-like state of the three groups of ESLD probands can be explained by the presence of psychopathological, neurodevelopmental, or neurobiological features observed in their first-degree relatives.||The probands of the three groups of ESLD (pre-schizotypal ESLD, schizotypal ESLD, and prodromal ESLD), early schizophrenia, and normal controls will be recruited by the Component Project 1 of this PPG. On the basis of these probands, this Component Project will recruit their first-degree relatives to participate in the study. Part of these probands will have neurobiological assessment conducted in Component Project 2. Part of the family identified in this Component Project will be evaluated for help-seeking behavior. In these joined efforts, we will be able to decipher the psychopathological pathways for both genetic and environmental etiological factors.||Core Unit Code No: A Title: Core Unit of A Study on Psychopathological Progress of Early Schizophrenia-like Disorder (CUSOPRES) This PPG of Study on Psychopathological Progress of Early Schizophrenia-like Disorder (ESLD) [SOPRES] is composed of 4 inter-related projects: (1) A Phenomenological Prospective Follow-up Study of ESLD; (2) A Neurobiological Study of ESLD; (3) Family Genetic Study of ESLD; (4) Awareness and Pathways to Care in ESLD.||The study samples participate all these four projects. The major hypothesis of the SOPRES was based on neurodevelopmental etiological hypothesis of schizophrenia. The hypothesis testing is interrelated among three projects No.1, No.2 and No.3. The projects No.4 is supplementary to other 3 projects. This SOPRES belongs to a translational study. Project No.4 is essential to bridge the process for clinical application of this SOPRES.||Based on these predicted research activities commonly needed for these four projects of this PPG, an efficient Core Unit of this SOPRES (CUSOPRES) is mandatory for carrying out the research work smoothly. There are several sections of research-related work of this CUSOPRES||Administrative Coordination of this SOPRES:||This CUSOPRES has to coordinate the regular research meeting, to make record of this research meeting. Literature related to this SOPRES PPG has to be collected and to be distributed to all research participants. It has to monitor the reality of the progress of this SOPRES. The progress of sampling, data collection, data check, setting up computer data file has to be monitored weekly. Report of research progress has to be done and has to be distributed to all main researchers. All the filing system of this SOPRES has also to be done by this CUSOPRES.||2. Budget management: Some proportion of the budget are commonly used in three projects. Each project also has its own budget schedule. The salary system of all research assistant has to be scheduled and managed clearly. This budget is of government grant. Detailed descriptions and records of budget expenditure are critically demanded by the regulatory and census system of the government. The expenditure every year must to be regulated to meet the requirement of research activity. This CUSOPRES has to manage all these works. A full time business assistant is necessary.||3. Training of Research Assistants and Participant Researchers: This PPG OF SOPRES will recruit research assistants (RA) for sampling, for data collection and data management. In Taiwan, the job of RA is always in a temporary basis. They (RA) come and go. All these RA's enrolled have to receive a through training for their work to guarantee high training of data collection and data management. All participant young researchers of all different disciplines also have to arrange training program related to the SOPRES research activities. This training program has to be arranged, scheduled and managed by the CUSOPRES.||4. Manuscript Preparation and Submission. Other than collecting new data, this PPG also have abundant data bank of previous psychopathological studies. As stated in the preliminary work of these three projects, these data has to be analyzed along the progress of data collection of this SOPRES. These continuous data analysis will create many drafts of paper manuscripts. Thus, this SOPRES PPG will have many manuscripts preparations for submitting to international and/or domestic journals. Typing, editing, and the preparation of these manuscripts are part of the work of this CUSOPRES. This is one important supporting function of CUSOPRES.||5. Data management and Data Analysis After preliminary management of data collected from the study subjects, all research data have to be set up in suitable computer data bank. Data cleaning is important work. Integrated data analyses of this SOPRES are unique of this SOPRES PPG. Other than independent analysis of the specific project itself, coordinated and mutual data matching analysis is unique of this SOPRES. The clinical definition of ESLD will be validated by concurrent psychopathological data (Project No.1) and follow-up data, and will be validated by all different dimensions of neurobiological data (Project No.2). The clinically defined ESLD will also be validated by family genetic data. Most importantly, heterogeneity of ESLD will also be explored using statistical maneuvers and then, will receive further validation study.||Data Structure and Statistical data analysis||Figure1 illustrates the possible data relationship and statistical analysis tools and data analysis strategies to be involved in and incorporated into the project. Structure of data sets to be collected by four component projects is very complicate in nature:||. Data sets to be collected by all four projects are inter-correlated and dependent. Subjects may be stratified by various relationships among all four projects.|. Data sets are highly multidimensional. Each program project employees multiple interviewing and measurement tables. Subjects match different criteria may have different sets of measurements.|. These measurements have different scales: ratio, interval, ordinal, nominal. Multivariate variables with different scales will be studied simultaneously.|. Some of the subjects/measurements combinations may have longitudinal pattern with follow-up studies.|. Data sets collected by Project 3 may be of dependent nature - samples are clustered as families.||Due to the high complexity of the data structure involved, the core unit has the following strategies to handle the statistical data analyses for all different project/subject/table/variable combination and situation:||. Descriptive statistics and various exploratory data analysis (EDA) tools will first be used to study the basic distribution structure for all the subjects/variables collected. This provides the researchers most of the univariate distributions and some of the associations structure of tables.|. Generalized association plots (GAP), developed by Dr. Chun-houh Chen (Chen 2002) for our previous projects, will also be used to explore the basic clustering structure of subjects and grouping structure of variables and the interaction patterns of the subject-clusters with variable-groups for each individual data table and combination of tables. This provides us an overall picture of data structure for all the subjects/tables involved.|. Many conventional multivariate statistical analysis tools will be employed to conduct further exploratory analyses and some confirmatory studies for the data.|. Various statistical testing procedures will also be used to verify and answer some of the hypotheses generated and proposed by all four component projects. The results may lead to new or modified hypotheses. Statistical analyses and hypothesis testing procedures will be performed again to verify the new hypotheses.|. Various statistical and epidemiological genetic analysis tools are to be used for analyzing the familial data generated by project 3.|. Latent class model (LCM) developed by Dr. Huang (Huang & Bandeen-Roche 2004, Huang 2005) can be used to study subject clustering pattern for various project/table combination.|. CateGAP, longGAP, canoGAP will be applied to study the categorical, longitudinal, and canonical relationship data structure respectively.|. New statistical methodologies and data analysis procedures suitable for analyzing specific data pattern to be generated by all four projects will be developed by the statisticians of the core unit when there is the need.||6. International and Domestic Communication Related to academic activities of this SOPRES, this SOPRES focuses on the up-to-date psychopathological study issue. All participant researchers of this SOPRES have abundant communication with other academic institutes or personnel for academic interests. This CUSOPRES has to manage all these communications.||7. The GENOP research team of this SOPRES program has also done the positional cloning study in order to find the vulnerability gene of schizophrenia in an independent molecular genetic study on SCH. We have found 12 potential candidate vulnerability genes up to now. In the coming years, there will be risk mutations identified in these vulnerability genes. These risk mutations will be as the direct genetic marker to validate the different groups of ESLD. This core unit will hire one assistant of bachelor degree to do blood sample collection and DNA extraction, as well as lymphocyte immortalization by EBV transformation.||8. Summary and Significance||This PPG of ""A Study on Psychopathological Progress of Early Schizophrenia-like Disorder (SOPRES)"" was designed to validate Early Schizophrenia-like Disorder (ESLD) defined clinically, using neurodevelopmental-associated core psychopathology. The SOPRES will recruit subjects of potential cases of ESLD using clinical psychopathological data obtained by self-report and face-to-face interview approach. Three groups of ESLD will be defined: (1) pre-schizotypal (or pan-neurotic), (2) schizotypal and (3) prodromal groups. These three groups represent three steps of psychopathological progress of ESLD. Using prospective follow-up design, the conversion rates of these three groups converted into successive group and into frank psychotic state of schizophrenia will be revealed. These clinically defined cases will be validated using neurobiological indicators, such as neuropsychological, neurophysiological, niacin skin flushing test, neurochemical, neuroanatomical indicators (Project No.2) as well as family genetic epidemiological data (Project No.3). The subtypes of ESLD will also be delineated using these validation procedures. The awareness, reaction and coping strategy of the patients and the family care-givers will be elicited as well. This SOPRES is 5-year study design, which includes 4 study periods: (1) half year preparation, (2) 2 years of case recruitment, (3) 2 years of follow-up and (4) half year ending and data management.||The psychopathology of schizophrenia has been well studied in the past decade. The SOPRES is a translational study design to examine the psychopathological progress of the pre-psychotic state of schizophrenia based on neurodevelopmental hypothesis of schizophrenia. This SOPRES is, thus, of high academic merit in the study of schizophrenia psychopathology. This SOPRES will demonstrate the successful application of basic neurobiological study data on clinical condition of ESLD.||This SOPRES will successfully set up a battery for valid diagnostic assessment of ESLD covering multidimensional psychopathology and it will also reveal the psychological progress of ESLD. This valid diagnostic assessment of ESLD will identify cases of ESLD from the cases with school failure, job difficulty, and of anxiety-depressive disorders in general psychiatric clinics. This will be helpful for avoiding the undesirable clinical condition of mis-diagnosis and mis-treatment. This will also substantiate the background for the development of further frontier of early intervention of ESLD. As schizophrenia is a devastating disease for the patient himself/herself, the family and the society. It also carries heavy psychosocial stigma. The result of SOPRES will be very helpful for building up early, intervention of schizophrenia, and will contribute a lot in reducing the cost of schizophrenia. The SOPRES study results regarding the awareness and coping strategy of the patients and the family will provide useful empirical data for developing psychosocial service for the ESLD.||This SOPRES study will provide the learning experience for participating researchers, including research assistants in the area of developing diagnostic assessment, combing clinical psychopathology and neurobiological pathology of early pre-psychotic state of schizophrenia. This experience will cultivate the future professional persons in the research area of preventive psychiatry.||9. Institutional Environment and Resources||This PPG of SOPRES will be carried out with the main researcher center located at the Department of Psychiatry, National Taiwan University Hospital and College of Medicine, National Taiwan University. There are main psychiatric hospitals affiliated with this research center. Massive case and family recruitment in local and nationwide programs for molecular genetic study of schizophrenia has been carried out by this research center and the affiliated hospitals. This research center has been doing psychopathological study on schizophrenia in its academic tradition. This research center is one part of the active medical campus of the National Taiwan University. Multidisciplinary team related to neurobiological study has been organized for years. These neurobiological studies of neuropsychological, neurophysiological and neuroimaging fields and neurobiological technology have been well developed. This university medical campus is very active in collaborating with other research sections as shown by this PPG of SOPRES. The Department of Imaging, Department of Neurology, Department of Nursing, and Department of Psychiatry, College of Medicine; Department of Psychology, College of Science, Department of Social Worker, College of Social Science, Institute of Epidemiology, College of Public Health of the same University are integrated with this PPG. The active research centers of statistical science located in Academia Sinica, and National Chiao Tung University, as well as Institute of Anthropology, National Tsing Hua University are also integrated into this PPG of SOPRES. These institutions are all engaged in biomedical research actively and also encouraging researchers to pursuit incultidisciplinary collaborative research too. The clinical phenomenological study, follow-up study, genetic laboratory, the neuropsychological, neurophysiological, the neuroimaging technique, and statistical technology are well equipped and well developed in these collaborative research centers and well mastered by these participating researchers.||Besides, this research center is the leading center of psychopathological study and service in the area of adolescent Psychiatry. There was wide and intensive connection between this research center and schools. Besides, this research center has also been involved with public mental health promotion through Mental Health Foundation (MHF). These intensive connections and wide resources are crucial for the successful case recruitment of ESLD targeted by this SOPRES program., Schizophrenia|PPI|P50I|MRS|Niacin|Candidate Genes"
2	A Study of Transition to the Paliperidone Palmitate 3-Month Formulation In Participants With Schizophrenia Previously Stabilized on the Paliperidone Palmitate 1-Month Formulation, This is an international, multicenter (study conducted at multiple sites) study designed to estimate remission rates and assess treatment response, tolerability, and patterns of use of Paliperidone Palmitate 3-Month Formulation (PP3M) in a diverse population of participants with schizophrenia. The study will consist of a screening phase (Day -7 to Day 1), a 52-week, open-label, flexible-dose PP3M treatment phase and a follow up safety assessment 3 months ( +/-14 days ) after the month 12 visit or early discontinuation.

2	Safety and Efficacy of an Anti-Psychotic in Patients With Schizophrenia, Paliperidone palmitate is an aqueous suspension that releases paliperidone gradually over a period of about 1 month and is under development to provide a sustained and stable level of paliperidone. This is a randomized (patients will be assigned to different treatment groups based solely on chance), double-blind (neither the patient nor the physician will know if placebo or drug is being given and at what dose), placebo-controlled, multicenter study in patients with schizophrenia. The study consists of a screening period (maximum 5 days, including a 3-day washout of psychotropic medications other than antidepressants, if applicable); a 7-day, open-label, oral run-in period; and a 64-day double-blind treatment period. The total duration of the study is approximately 11 weeks. Efficacy will be evaluated during the study using the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale for Schizophrenia (PANSS) and the Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S) scale. Safety will be evaluated by monitoring adverse events and changes in clinical laboratory results, including prolactin levels; physical examination results; tardive dyskinesia will be rated using the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS), akathisia will be rated according to the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS), extrapyramidal symptoms will be evaluated using the Simpson-Angus Rating Scale (SAS); electrocardiogram (ECG); vital sign measurements; and concomitant therapy. ER OROS paliperidone (6 or 12 mg) or IR paliperidone (2 or 4 mg) oral dosage administered daily for 7 days (Day -7 to -1), followed by i.m. injections of paliperidone palmitate (either 50 mg eq. or 100 mg eq.), or placebo on Days 1, 8, and 36 of the study., Schizophrenia|Paliperidone palmitate|R092670|antipsychotic
2	"TDCS for Auditory Hallucinations in Schizophrenia, 90 patients with persistent auditory verbal hallucinations will be recruited to this study. Each individual will participate in behavioral assessments lasting up to 3 hours each and will then be randomized to receive a series of active vs. sham tDCS treatments. For active treatment, patients will have the inhibitory (cathodal) tDCS electrode placed over left auditory cortex relative to an anodal placed over frontal cortex on the right side. tDCS treatments will take place for 20 min per day for 5 consecutive days. For sham, procedures will be similar except that sham (inactive) tDCS treatment will be used. Assessment batteries will then be repeated following completion of treatment and at 1 and 3 mo following treatment. In addition, patients will be offered the possibility to participate in a concurrent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study aimed at evaluating the effects of tDCS on activation of auditory cortex during an auditory discrimination task as well as on other imaging parameters related to resting brain activity and metabolism. Patients who agree to participate in this MRI study will be scanned before and after active or sham tDCS. In addition, 5-15 schizophrenia patients will complete a week of High-density, e.g., ""high-definition"" tDCS (HD-tDCS) open label.||In addition to hallucinating patients, we will recruit up to 20 healthy controls and 20 non-hallucinating patients, who will have similar assessments to the patients, but will not receive tDCS.||Overall, the investigators hypothesize that tDCS treatment will lead to reduction in hallucinations, improvement in auditory function, and change in EEG and MRI measurements so that patients more closely resemble healthy volunteers and non-hallucinating patients., Schizophrenia"

2	Effects of RG1068 (Secretin) on Information Processing in Schizophrenia, In a recent placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter study of Secretin in refractory schizophrenics, we found that a patient who received Secretin (1.0 g/kg) intravenously, showed a marked improvement in eye blink conditioning following infusion. This subject also showed a clinical improvement of > 20% on the Total Score and Total Negative Score of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to confirm and extend this observation in a larger group of individuals with schizophrenia. In this 24 to 48 hour experiment, the acquisition and extinction of the conditioned blink response will be assessed in participants with schizophrenia who are randomly assigned to one of two double blind treatment groups: (1) subcutaneous saline or (2) subcutaneous Secretin (20 ug/kg). Enrolled participants will remain on their stable medication regime (i.e., psychotropic medications and related treatments will not be manipulated). Furthermore, given evidence that Secretin administration increases the amygdala's activation during experimental presentation of fear-related facial cue stimuli, we wish to also investigate the effects of the experimental agent on psychophysiological processes putatively related to amygdala function. Prepulse inhibition is a widely studied paradigm in the schizophrenia literature, thought to reflect disruption of early sensory-motor gating that is present in both individuals with schizophrenia and their unaffected biological relatives, and can be mediated by various limbic structures including the amygdala. Therefore, as a secondary aim, the effects of Secretin will be tested on affect modulation, pre-pulse inhibition, and pre-pulse facilitation of the acoustic startle response using common psychophysiological research procedures. These procedures are frequently used in our laboratory and are currently approved for our use by the IRBs at both IUPUI and IUB., Schizophrenia|Secretin
2	Anti-inflammatories and Adolescent Schizophrenia, Patients will be evaluated to confirm the diagnosis of schizophrenia, duration of the disease and record a history of atopic diseases or recurrent infections throughout life. The PANSS, PSP, and MCCB battery scales will be administered. A blood sample will be taken for the determination of markers of inflammation before the start of pharmacological treatment.||Patients will start the antipsychotic medication assigned by their treating physician. They will also be assigned randomly to the treatment arm. The study drug will be provided by the research team under the presentation of capsules containing Celecoxib 200 mg, Minocycline 100 mg or Placebo, and patients will be instructed to take one capsule every 12 hrs daily.||The patient will be reassessed with PANSS, PSP, and MCCB after completing 6 weeks of pharmacological treatment, type and dose of medication will be recorded and serum markers of inflammation will be determined again., schizophrenia|adolescents|inflammation|anti-inflammatory
2	Study of CAD-9303 in Subjects With Schizophrenia, This study will be conducted in two Parts. Part 1 will consist of Single Ascending Dose (SAD) cohorts that will be randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of CAD-9303. Part 2 will consist of Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) cohorts that will be randomized, double blind, and placebo-controlled to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of CAD-9303. The effects of CAD-9303 will be explored on event-related potential (ERP), and on sensory and cognitive function. The first SAD cohort will be in healthy volunteer subjects. The remaining cohorts will be in participants with schizophrenia. Participants will meet specified eligibility criteria.||SAD Cohorts will be comprised of 8 subjects; 6 subjects will be administered CAD-9303, and 2 subjects will be administered matching placebo. MAD Cohorts will be comprised of 12 subjects; 9 subjects will be administered CAD-9303, and 3 subjects will be administered matching placebo.||Potential subjects will undergo a screening period (up to 28 days), baseline assessments on Day -3, -2 and -1, and dosing on Day 1 for SAD and Days 1 - 14 for MAD. A follow-up visit will occur 7 days after the last dose. The total duration of individual subject participation may be up to 5 weeks for SAD and 7 weeks for MAD, depending on the duration of the screening period.||The study will assess safety by adverse events, vital signs, laboratory parameters (including chemistry, hematology and urinalysis) and electroencephalogram (EEG); pharmacokinetics of CAD-9303; and exploratory efficacy measures effects on neurophysiological biomarkers, cognitive and negative symptoms., 0
2	Evaluation of the Functional Remission Occurrence and Predictive Factors in Schizophrenia, Prospective, national, noninterventional study. One year follow up with three evaluation dates (D0, D180 and D360). The participation of a subject in this study will in no way impact the regular care of the subject or any benefits they are otherwise entitled to. All treatment decisions will be made at the discretion of the participating physician, in accordance with his clinical practice and with approved local prescribing information. Only data available from clinical practice will be collected. Evaluation methods: patient history and clinical examination, clinical global impression (CGI): Improvement in CGI, social performance evaluation [functional remission of general schizophrenia (FROGS scale)], clinical remission evaluation: 8 items of the Positive and negative syndrome (PANSS) Scale, psychosocial remission evaluation (PSP scale), current insight evaluation: insight scale for psychosis, subjective well being under neuroleptic treatment (SWN scale), health condition [Euro quality of life - 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D)]; Judgment Criteria: functional remission is defined as an overall score of greater than or equal to (>=) 57 on the FROGS scale, functional response is defined as improvement of >= 7 points on the FROGS scale.

2	Training-induced Cerebral Reorganization in Schizophrenia, Impairment in cognitive functions is one of the main symptoms in schizophrenia and is currently one of the challenges in the treatment of the disease.||In this study we compare effects of two computer-aided training programs. One focused on auditory perception and processing as a basic ability underlying higher order information processing.||The other training involves a variability of cognitive abilities.||Both trainings are computer-aided and time-intensive, including up to twenty sessions within four weeks., schizophrenia|neuroplasticity|sensory gating|cognitive impairment|MEG|Disorders with Psychotic Features
2	Psychosocial Therapy and Risperidone Treatment in Work Performance in Recent-Onset Schizophrenia, Schizophrenia is a chronic, severe, and disabling brain disorder. People with schizophrenia often experience hallucinations, delusions, thought disorders, and movement disorders. These symptoms make it difficult to maintain a job, participate in school, and keep up self-care. Proper treatment of first-episode schizophrenia may increase the chances of controlling disease progression on a long-term basis. Antipsychotic medications, such as risperidone, and psychosocial treatments, such as cognitive enhancement training and health behavior training, are common, effective treatments for schizophrenia. This study will determine the effectiveness of various combinations of psychosocial therapy and risperidone treatment in improving work or school performance in people with first-episode schizophrenia.||Participants in this open label study will be randomly assigned to receive one of the following four combinations of an antipsychotic medication and a psychosocial treatment: cognitive enhancement training plus oral risperidone; cognitive enhancement training plus long-acting injectable risperidone; health behavior training plus oral risperidone; or health behavior training plus long-acting injectable risperidone. Cognitive enhancement training will entail 2 hours per week of computer-assisted training targeted at improving attention, memory, and problem-solving skills. Additionally, participants will attend a weekly 1-hour group meeting to learn how to apply these skills to work and school situations. Health behavior training will involve 3 hours per week of relaxation training, nutrition education, and physical exercise to enhance wellness. Participants assigned to receive oral risperidone will receive their medication in pill form at the dosage determined to be optimal by the study psychiatrist. Participants assigned to receive injectable risperidone will be given one injection every 2 weeks. Dosages will start at 25 mg per injection and will be adjusted as needed.||Treatment will continue for 1 year following dosage stabilization, which typically occurs 2 to 3 months following study entry. For the first 6 months, participants assigned to receive health behavior training will attend study visits once a week and participants assigned to receive cognitive enhancement training will attend study visits once a week. For the final 6 months, all participants will attend study visits twice weekly. At each visit, participants will receive their assigned psychosocial treatment; attend group therapy; meet with a case manager for counseling and assessment of symptoms, work functioning, and social functioning; and meet with a psychiatrist to monitor medication response. Additional cognitive and health behavior measures will be taken every 6 months to assess treatment effectiveness., Schizoaffective Disorder, Depressed Type|Schizophreniform Disorder|First-Episode Schizophrenia|Supported Employment|Cognitive Remediation|Health Behavior Training|Antipsychotic Medication
2	A Twelve Week, Open Label Extension Study in Patients With Schizophrenia, This is a 12-week, multi-center, open-label extension study designed to evaluate the longer-term safety, tolerability and effectiveness of lurasidone for the treatment of subjects with schizophrenia who have participated in Study D1050238, a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal study of lurasidone for the maintenance treatment of subjects with schizophrenia. Subjects who have completed the 28-week double-blind phase or who have experienced a protocol-defined relapse event during the double-blind phase of study D1050238 will have the option to participate in this study. In addition, if/when the study is discontinued by the sponsor, all subjects participating in the open-label phase and the double-blind phase of study D1050238 will have the option to participate in this extension study, Lurasidone|Latuda|Schizophrenia
2	The Mid-term Effect of Repeated Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation on Schizophrenia, Medications have a poor effect on negative symptoms and cognitive function in schizophrenia. In the past, most of the studies on repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation intervention in patients with schizophrenia used conventional stimulation sites and patterns, and the intervention effect was still controversial. A few studies have achieved positive results with the new stimulation model (TBS model) and the therapeutic target (cerebellar vermis), but the follow-up period did not exceed 2 weeks, and no similar studies have emerged in China. Therefore, this study hypothesized that the TBS-mode rTMS intervention in the cerebellar vermis can improve the negative symptoms, cognitive function, and depressive symptoms of schizophrenia, and the efficacy can be maintained.||Aim of the study: 1.1 To explore the clinical efficacy of cerebellar vermal theta burst stimulation for negative symptoms, cognitive function and depressive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. 1.2 The patients were followed up for 24 weeks to explore the duration of rTMS efficacy|Introduction of the study: This is a multi-center, randomized, sham-controlled, double-blinded trial. Participants diagnosed with schizophrenia from Shanghai Mental Health Center and six district-level mental health centers were randomized according to the odd-even sequence of enrollment, with odd numbers into the study group and even numbers into the control group. Patients in the study group received 100%MT rTMS with the intermittent theta burst stimulation paradigm, while another patients were subjected to pseudo-stimulation treatment, both being given 2-week intervention (5 times per week). The type and dose of antipsychotic drugs taken by patients remained unchanged during the intervention period. Efficacy were assessed with the Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale (PANSS), Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD-24) and MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB)., Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation|Schizophrenia|Cerebellar vermis|Negative symptoms|Depressive symptoms|Cognitive function|Follow-up study
2	Aripiprazole Once-monthly Versus Daily Oral Atypical Antipsychotic Treatment in Patients With Recent-onset Schizophrenia, This is an observational, non-interventional study that will include two cohorts of patients with schizophrenia who initiated maintenance treatment during a schizophrenia-related hospitalisation or during the immediate three months after hospital discharge: patients who initiated maintenance treatment with AOM and patients who initiated maintenance treatment with any daily oral atypical AP.||The date of maintenance treatment initiation will be considered the index date (see definition of maintenance treatment initiation in Section 3.1). Baseline data will be collected immediately after the inclusion of the patient in the study (including retrospective data from the index date to the date of informed consent and from the past 5 years). From the index date, each patient will be followed up until discontinuation of the maintenance treatment of interest and up to a maximum of 12 months. Especially after the implementation of the Global Amendment nº1, it is possible that the complete follow-up of the patient took place in the past (retrospective data), i.e. before the inclusion of the subject in the study. Data will be collected from the patient file and from information obtained during routine visits scheduled according to clinical practice., adherence|long-acting injectable antipsychotic|all-cause treatment discontinuation|recent-onset schizophrenia|daily oral atypical antipsychotic
2	Effectiveness of Antipsychotic Combination With Psychosocial Intervention on Outcome of Patients With Schizophrenia, The study is designed as a national, multicenter, randomized, naturalistic trial, with research assessors intended to be blind to the intervention status.||We plan to recruit 1400 patients at 10 china sites and randomly assign them to two group. the control group only receive antipsychotic and the study group receive antipsychotic combination with psychosocial intervention. The course is 12 months. Patients use one of the seven study drugs (chlorpromazine, sulpiride, clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, and aripitrazole)to the maintain treatment. The psychosocial intervention include psychoeducation, family intervention, skills training, and cognitive-behavioral therapy. The primary aim is to delineate differences in the overall effectiveness of the two treatment model.The assessments include the outcome of symptomatology，neurobiology，social psychology，medical economics., schizophrenia|antipsychotic|outcome|psychosocial intervention
2	Carnosine and Cognitive Training in Schizophrenia, Compromised cognitive functioning is a core feature of schizophrenia, yet it remains a major unmet need in the treatment of schizophrenia. Current available therapeutic approaches to enhance cognition in schizophrenia - either pharmacological or non-pharmacological (for a review) have yielded, at best, only modest results with questionable retention of the cognitive benefits and generalization of the effects into functional benefit. The investigators propose a novel approach to enhance cognition in schizophrenia: combining a food supplement with cognitive training, rather than using each intervention alone.||Aim is to test the primary hypothesis that the combination of L-carnosine with cognitive training will significantly increase the performance of patients with schizophrenia on memory and learning training tasks compared to pairing cognitive training with placebo. The investigators will also test the secondary hypotheses that in the group receiving L-carnosine increased performance is due to a greater learning rate. Carnosine has antioxidant and antiglycating action and is found in food and the human body. The investigator's choice is guided by several considerations but, primarily the evidence that L-carnosine has neuroprotective effects through its antioxidant features. Briefly, the investigators propose that alterations in metabolism in several neurotransmitter systems (particularly glutamate) can both contribute to, and be modified by, oxidative stress, and therefore antioxidant administration could positively affect neurotransmitter role in synaptic plasticity, learning and memory.||Carnosine has shown some improvements in cognitive outcomes in autism (Chez et al, 2002) and schizophrenia (Chengappa et al; unpublished). Chez used oral doses of 800mg/d for 8 weeks; while the latter study used oral doses of 2000mg for 4 weeks showing positive effects. Hence this is the dose and delivery route that will be used. The investigators have opted for 4 weeks course following broadly from these two studies. Carnosine is widely available from health and food supplement shops in the UK and US retail market in highly pure form; is a naturally occurring in food and the human body; and is well-tolerated and has a benign side-effect profile, as shown from previous trials, and is therefore not associated with any potential risks., L-Carnosine|Schizophrenia|Psychosis|Cognition
2	A Study of the Long-term Safety and Tolerability and the Long-term Effectiveness of Extended-release Oral Paliperidone in Patients Diagnosed With Schizophrenia, The controlled rate of drug delivery provided by the extended-release oral formulation of paliperidone may provide improved effectiveness and a reduced risk of certain adverse effects in patients with schizophrenia, by avoiding peaks and troughs of drug levels in the blood. This could in turn provide an improved quality of life and overall functioning for patients.||This open-label study is an extension of a 6-week randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study in which the effectiveness and safety of 4 different oral treatments administered once daily are compared in patients with schizophrenia: paliperidone 6 or 12 milligrams (mg), olanzapine 10 mg (an approved treatment for schizophrenia), or placebo. Following the double-blind treatment phase, eligible patients may enter this 52-week open-label extension with slow, extended-release paliperidone (with no comparison treatments). In the open-label extension, all patients, regardless of their randomized treatment in the double-blind phase, will begin on extended-release paliperidone 9 mg once daily. Thereafter, patients will be maintained on a flexible dosage of extended-release paliperidone throughout the 52-week study. The dosage may be increased or decreased within this range in accordance with the clinical judgment of the investigator, based on observations of patient response and tolerability. Because flexible dosing more closely mimics clinical practice, this design may provide more clinically relevant findings in the open-label setting.The final visit in the double-blind phase may serve as the initial visit for the open-label extension. Study visits will occur at Day 4 and then weekly for the first 4 weeks (Weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4) and then every 4 weeks through Week 52 or until early termination. Evaluations of the safety and effectiveness of extended-release paliperidone treatment will be performed at scheduled times throughout the open-label extension. Flexible dosage (3, 6, 9, or 12 milligrams (mg)) extended-release paliperidone tablets administered orally once daily for 52 weeks, following a 6-week double-blind study in which patients receive fixed oral doses of 6 mg or 12 mg extended-release paliperidone or olanzapine 10 mg., schizophrenia|extended release|oral administration|antipsychotic agents|dementia praecox|mental disorders|paliperidone|PANSS
2	"Biomarker Strategies for Medication-Enhanced Cognitive Training in Schizophrenia, This R34 application responds to PAR-09-173, to achieve the first goal of this FOA by supporting: ""the development and/or pilot testing of new or adapted interventions."" The two overarching goals of this application are: 1) to test the effects of the acute administration of the NMDA antagonist, memantine (MEM), on sensorimotor gating and working memory (WM) in schizophrenia (SZ) patients, and 2) to assess the feasibility of using MEM to predictably enhance the therapeutic benefits of cognitive training in SZ.||The pharmacotherapy of SZ has been dominated by antidopaminergic drugs with limited clinical impact. Some forms of psychosocial rehabilitation, such as cognitive training (CT), appear to effectively reduce symptoms and improve function in SZ. The premise of this application is that the benefits of CT in SZ might be enhanced by drugs that increase specific cognitive abilities, including WM, even if these pro-cognitive drugs lack clinical impact when administered without CT. The main goal of this application is to develop an innovative intervention strategy that enhances the clinical benefits of CT in SZ through administration of a pro-cognitive agent to biomarker-identified sensitive patients.||The investigators reported that a single dose of the widely used Alzheimer's disease medication, MEM (20 mg p.o.), significantly increased prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the startle reflex in healthy subjects. PPI-enhancing effects of MEM in healthy subjects are associated with: 1) increased WM; and 2) phenotypes linked to the high activity Val158Met COMT polymorphism. PPI is consistently impaired in SZ patients; lowest levels of PPI in patients are associated with: 1) poor functional outcome; and 2) the Val/Val COMT genotype. If our MEM findings in healthy subjects are reproduced in SZ patients, the investigators will detect MEM-associated improvements in PPI and WM, particularly among Val/Val patients. The investigators will then be positioned to test the hypothesis that acute PPI and WM-enhancing effects of MEM predict therapeutic benefit of MEM in SZ patients undergoing CT.||This application has two aims: Aim 1 will assess the acute effects of MEM (0 vs. 10 or 0 vs. 20 mg p.o.) in 60 SZ patients, to test the prediction that MEM will increase PPI and enhance WM in SZ patients, particularly in those characterized by low basal PPI levels and/or the Val/Val COMT genotype. Mismatch negativity and gamma band synchronization will also be assessed as potentially informative MEM-sensitive and functionally relevant biomarkers. Aim 2 will assess the feasibility of testing the therapeutic benefit of MEM as an adjunct to CT in SZ patients, and the feasibility of testing the primary hypothesis that such benefit will be predicted by increased PPI and/or WM in SZ patients after the Aim 1 single dose MEM challenge. It is predicted that subject recruitment and completion in both arms of a controlled 12-week CT trial in SZ out-patients among subjects completing Aim 1 will be appropriate for testing both the overall effectiveness of MEM as an adjunct to CT and the ability to predict this effectiveness among biomarker-identified patient subgroups., Schizophrenia|prepulse inhibition|neurocognition|working memory|memantine|MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery"

2	Efficacy, Safety and Pharmacokinetics Study of CPL500036 (PDE10A Inhibitor) in Patients With Schizophrenia, This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled, parallel group, dose ranging study to explore the efficacy, safety, tolerability and PK of 2 different doses of CPL500036 (phosphodiesterase 10A [PDE10A] inhibitor) in patients with an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia. Approximately 165 patients will be randomized at a 1:1:1 ratio and will be dosed with 20 mg CPL500036, 40 mg CPL500036 or placebo once daily for 28 consecutive days (Day 1 to Day 28). Patients will remain in house for the duration of the Treatment Period. The study will comprise of a Screening Period (that will include a prior Medication Washout Period), a Treatment Period and a Follow-up Period. After discharge from the Clinical Unit, patients will return to the Clinical Unit for 2 once weekly Follow-up Visits. Approximately 30% of the patients (17 patients in each of the 3 treatment groups) will undergo extensive PK sampling during the Treatment Period, and the remaining 70% of the patients will only undergo sparse PK sampling., 0

2	Disturbances of Kynurenine Pathway of Trytophan Metabolism in Schizophrenia: A Quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) Study, In this pilot study, we propose to characterize the pattern of activation of the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism in peripheral macrophages of patients with schizophrenia. To do this, we will measure the gene expression of several major enzymes in this pathway in macrophages, including the key enzyme involved in tryptophan to kynurenine metabolism, IDO, by means of quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The focus on enzyme mRNA expression as opposed to serum or cerebrospinal fluid levels of metabolites provides a possibly more sensitive characterization of the activation of this metabolic pathway.||Primary hypotheses: We hypothesize that patients with schizophrenia will differ in their expression of macrophage IDO mRNA, reflecting activation of this pathway compared to normals. We further hypothesize that patients with deficit syndrome will have higher degrees of enzyme activation.||Secondary hypotheses: Serum tryptophan levels will be lower in patients with schizophrenia compared to controls, and they will correlate with measures of dysphoria. Serum kynurenine levels will be elevated in patients with schizophrenia, particularly in deficit syndrome patients. mRNA expression levels of enzymes downstream from IDO will differ between patients and controls. Measures of immune activation will be influenced by medical disease burden (medical comorbidities)., Schizophrenia|Immune System|Kynurenate|tryptophan metabolism|NMDA receptor|indolamine 2,3-deoxygenase (IDO)
2	Expanding Rapid Ascertainment Networks of Schizophrenia Families in Taiwan, Over the past four decades, researchers have become increasingly certain that schizophrenia has a complex, multifactorial etiology. Although many twin studies confirm that genes play a substantial role in the etiology of this disabling disorder,5 genome-wide linkage analysis of schizophrenia have produced conflicting results. While many of these studies have identified chromosomal regions showing some evidence for linkage to schizophrenia, no finding has been consistently replicated. Given the high heritability of schizophrenia,5 the failure of linkage methods to find susceptibility genes suggests that these genes each have very small, incremental effects on the expression of the disorder. Risch and Merikangas6 showed that for genes of small effect, the power of linkage studies will be low but the power of association studies will be high. Although meta-analysis of candidate gene association studies have implicated some genes, these findings (even if confirmed by larger studies) would only account for a small fraction of schizophrenia's heritability. These considerations suggest that a genome-wide association scan would be an effective method for finding schizophrenia susceptibility genes. To that end, the investigators have designed a multi-stage analytic plan which involves rapid continued ascertainment of probands and family members from an established clinical ascertainment network in Taiwan, performing a genome-wide association scan (GWAS) on this large sample of affected nuclear families, and pooling the novel GWAS results from this project with those from existing case-control GWAS studies of schizophrenia. To accomplish these objectives, the investigators propose a series of specific aims, as follows:||Supplement our previously collected sample of 1,200 Han Chinese schizophrenia-affected nuclear families from Taiwan by rapidly screening and collecting an additional 3,800 trios from eleven ascertainment sites in Taiwan;|Assess the association of schizophrenia with a genome-wide panel of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and their constituent haplotypes;|Perform a genome-wide survey for copy-number variations related to schizophrenia;|Test for gene-gene interactions and epistasis;|Test for gene-environment interactions, such as the well-established effect of season of birth;|Analyze quantitative schizophrenia phenotypes, such as age at onset; and|Enhance the NIMH Genetics Initiative collections by sending all clinical data, biomaterials, and genotypes to the appropriate repositories, and completing a meta-analysis of our family-based GWAS data and those from existing case-control GWASs of schizophrenia in the repository;||The above aims achieve the goals of the RFA in several ways. First, the proposed work would markedly enrich the existing resources of the NIMH Human Genetics Initiative, especially the current pool of schizophrenia-affected nuclear families. Not only would the data and biomaterials from this project enrich the NIMH repositories, the study has been designed to be readily combinable with those already in the repositories to boost the power available for detecting genes with small effects on risk. Further, the proposed project would apply the latest genomic research methods to further our understanding of the molecular etiology of the disorder. Lastly, by capitalizing on an existing clinical infrastructure and an efficient screening and assessment protocol, the investigators will obtain a well-powered sample in a very rapid and cost-effective manner., schizophrenia|genome-wide association study (GWAS)|single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)|Han Chinese population|trio families|Schizophrenia with trio families
2	"Cognitive Enhancement Therapy for Early-Stage Schizophrenia, In this study, we wish to determine the neurobiological predictors and the relative efficacy of Cognitive Enhancement Therapy (CET) in ameliorating specific cognitive abnormalities presumably mediated by PFC and related brain structures, among younger, early-course schizophrenia patients who potentially have a better prognosis. A series of recent-onset schizophrenic patients, whose psychotic symptoms have successfully been stabilized on an atypical antipsychotic drug for one year following initiation of treatment, will be randomized to CET combined with an enriched supportive therapy (EST) or EST alone, and treated for two years. Subjects will have been assessed on neurobehavioral and clinical indices immediately prior to beginning CET or EST (corresponding with the CNMD 1-year follow-up) and in the proposed study will again be assessed after 1 and 2 years of psychosocial treatment. In a smaller subset of patients, we will also seek to collect preliminary data on the efficacy of CET in reversing the neurobiological alterations in the PFC. The hypotheses of this study are:||The presence of relatively well preserved PFC structure and function (PFC volume, activation with fMRI, and metabolism as measured by proton MRS) at baseline will predict a better response to CET (Neurobiological Prediction Hypothesis).|CET combined with ""enriched"" supportive psychotherapy (EST) will be more effective than EST alone in ameliorating social and non-social cognitive deficits of patients with early schizophrenic illness whose psychotic symptoms have been stabilized on maintenance chemotherapy (The Treatment Efficacy Hypothesis).|CET will result in additive, positive effects on neurocognitive parameters that were not observed following one year of antipsychotic medication, using a ""sequential"" treatment design in a subset of patients in whom we have pre-neuroleptic baseline data from CNMD studies (The Treatment Specificity Hypothesis).||Study Design: Subjects will be randomly assigned, once stabilized clinically, to CET plus EST (n = 30) or EST alone (n = 30) and then treated for up to two years. Clinical, neuropsychological, neurological and functional neuroimaging assessments will be administered at baseline and at two annual follow-ups. At the end of CET or EST treatment, subjects will be asked to come back quarterly to meet informally with either their Cognitive Enhancement Therapy clinicians and former group members, or with their Enriched Supportive Therapy clinician. The purpose of these visits is for us to learn more about the successes that patients have had, or about the difficulties that they might have had since leaving the program. Clinician(s) will also share information obtained during this follow-up which might help patient in overcoming these difficulties. At the end of the one-year period post EST or CET treatment, subjects will be assessed on all measures, except for diagnostic, imaging and blood studies., Schizophrenia|Cognition|Enhancement|Randomized"
2	"Does Acute Oxytocin Administration Enhance Social Cognition in Individuals With Schizophrenia?, Schizophrenia is characterized by the presence of positive symptoms (delusions, hallucinations, disorganization of thought process and behavior) as well as negative symptoms (blunted affect, alogia, and avolition), neurocognitive deficits, and impaired social cognition. While positive symptoms can often respond well to antipsychotic medications, the latter symptoms are more difficult to treat. In this study, we will focus on social cognition, which is defined as the functions that are engaged during social interactions. Social cognition has been categorized into four main domains: theory of mind, social perception, attributional bias, and emotional processing. Social cognition in patients with schizophrenia has been found to be critical in predicting multiple aspects of community functioning. There are currently two broad approaches to improve social cognition in patients with schizophrenia: pharmacological and psychosocial interventions. While psychosocial interventions (training exercises to target improvement in domains of social cognition) have shown some benefit, their resultant improvements have been limited in their distribution across multiple domains as well as their generalization to improved functioning in the community. Pharmacological trials have yielded mixed results, and there are not any currently available medications that have been consistently found to improve social cognition in patients with schizophrenia2. One potential future therapeutic target for enhancing social cognition is the oxytocin system.||Oxytocin is a nine-amino acid peptide that, in addition to its role in the periphery for regulating lactation and uterine contractions, functions centrally as a neurotransmitter which is involved in multiple aspects of social behavior and related emotions. Specifically, it has been found to modulate emotion recognition, trust, eye contact, empathic accuracy, as well as envy and gloating. Given oxytocin's role in social functioning, in conjunction with the deficits in social functioning found frequently in individuals with schizophrenia, there have been several studies over the past three decades examining the oxytocin system in humans with schizophrenia and in rodent experimental models.||It has been found that individuals with schizophrenia do not show the same level of increase in oxytocin as normal controls in response to trust-related interpersonal interactions, and low plasma oxytocin predicted negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Additionally, it has also been found that plasma oxytocin levels predicted the ability of patients with schizophrenia to identify facial expressions. Finally, it has been found recently that sustained regular administration of intranasal oxytocin significantly reduced both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Thus, there is significant evidence supporting further research studying the effect of oxytocin on social cognition. It is not yet known if exogenous administration of oxytocin will have acute effects on neuropsychological measures of social cognition in individuals with schizophrenia, and this is the focus of this proposed pilot study.||The overall hypothesis guiding this study is that acute oxytocin administration will improve social cognition (as assessed by a composite score comprising two measures of ""low level"" social cognitive processes and two measures of ""high level"" social cognitive processes) in individuals with schizophrenia. Our primary goals are to assess the feasibility of this experimental paradigm and to generate pilot data and obtain estimates of effect sizes which can be used in planning future larger studies., Schizophrenia|Social Intelligence|Perception, Social|Oxytocin"
