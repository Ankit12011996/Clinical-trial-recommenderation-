2	Evaluation of Executive Function With Virtual Reality Among People With Schizophrenia, Background:||Schizophrenia often reflect by decrease in executive functions that may cause difficulty in Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL). We've found it very difficult to simulate these functions with the existing tools in the clinic and to assess IADL accordingly.||The use of Virtual Reality (VR) became popular in the last decade to overcome these limitations in clinical practice and assessment of functioning in IADL. VR is a computer program that simulates a functional environment in which the subject impacts on events through various actions. Recent studies indicated that VR can be used to assess cognitive abilities and functioning of population with schizophrenia. As far as we know, no researches were performed using Virtual Interactive Shopping (VIS) in this population, nor did dynamic evaluation was used to identify potential learning abilities. The aim of this study is to examine the validity of the shopping task in the VIS, performed statically and dynamically, in order to assess executive function, and the ability to reflect cognitive, functional and participation ability among people that diagnosed with schizophrenia.||Method:||This Cross-sectional Study Included Patients that diagnosed with schizophrenia, aged 18-55, 20 of which hospitalized in mental health department and 20 in medical follow-up.||Different test will be administered, in two or three sessions, to evaluate cognitive ability, function ability and participation.||The results of the VIS shopping task performance (statically & dynamically) and its correlation with the cognitive and function tests as well as the participation questionnaire will be examined. These findings will indicate whether the shopping task is valid to assess executive functions for people with schizophrenia and whether it is ecologically valid., Virtual Reality
2	Cognitive Remediation Therapy and Schizophrenia, Methods:||In a 2 arms blind study versus sham,80 patients with schizophrenia were enrolled in a program consisting of 14 training sessions of 4 cognitive functions (attention/concentration, topological memory, logical reasoning, executive functions)by means REHACOM® software. Measures of cognitive functioning using the Cogtest® battery as well as social autonomy (Social Autonomy Scale, EAS) and schizophrenia symptoms (Positive And Negative Syndrome Scale, PANSS) were undertaken at the beginning and the end of the meetings of remediation.||Among those 80 participants, 30 patients to (15 active / 15 sham) were randomized to participate in an fMRI study in order to investigate the impact of such CRT program on brain functioning (n-back task before CRT and 3 months later)., cognitive deficits
2	Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (TDCS) for Auditory Hallucinations in Early Onset Schizophrenia (EOS), Background: Early onset schizophrenia (EOS) involves positives symptoms such as psychotic behaviors, as well as negative symptoms such as disruptions to normal emotions and behaviors. Antipsychotics are the primary method of treatment in pediatric populations, but can produce unpleasant or dangerous side effects. Medication response is highly variable. Recent evidence demonstrates transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) relieving auditory hallucinations (AH) associated with schizophrenia in adults, and to a lesser degree negative and cognitive symptomology. Such studies provide important scientific and technical knowledge that may be applied to pediatric populations.||Hypothesis: 1. Primary: Youths with EOS will demonstrate amelioration of AH after administration of tDCS. 2. TDCS will be well-tolerated in pediatric populations with minimal adverse side effects., TDCS

This cognitive-behavioural program is delivered using a combination of story-based books and workshop sessions. The originality of the program comes from the use of story books that were not developed for anxiety management specifically. Every session is based on a story describing characters facing common stressors in childhood and how they managed to cope with their daily problems. In our randomized control trial with 46 children, participation in the program lead to a significant improvement in coping skills, self-efficacy, anxiety sensitivity, signs of anxiety and phobic avoidance. The theoretical and practical elements underlying the delivery of this primary prevention programs are described. It is suggested that such an approach, without any labelling specific to anxiety disorders, can be useful in universal primary prevention programs., No condition|Primary prevention|Anxiety"

2	An Open-Label Trial of Tocilizumab in Schizophrenia, Schizophrenia is a chronic, debilitating disorder with life-long consequences on affected individuals and families. Schizophrenia is also associated with impaired cognition or thinking, which persists despite currently available treatments, and is an important determinant of quality of life and overall function. Associations between immune system abnormalities and schizophrenia, in particular increased inflammation, are one of the more enduring findings in the field. Four of six trials found that treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was associated with significant improvement in psychopathology (Muller et al., 2010a; Muller et al., 2010b). Serum cytokine levels predicted response in two studies (Laan et al., 2010; Muller et al., 2004), and another study found a trend for improved cognition (Muller et al., 2005) with adjunctive NSAID treatment. These findings provide important empirical support for a pathophysiological role for inflammation in a subset of patients with schizophrenia.||Cytokines are key regulators of inflammation that exert effects in the periphery and the brain. IL-6 is a cytokine produced by peripheral blood leukocytes, and central nervous system microglia and astrocytes. Serum IL-6 levels are increased in patients with schizophrenia, and two studies reported significant positive correlations between IL-6 and total psychopathology at baseline and following antipsychotic treatment (Miller et al., 2011). Schizophrenia is associated with impaired cognition, which persists despite current treatments, and is an important determinant of quality of life and overall function. In populations outside of schizophrenia, higher serum IL-6 levels are associated with poorer cognition, cognitive decline, and smaller hippocampal gray matter volume (Marsland et al., 2006; Marsland et al., 2008). In a first-episode psychosis sample, IL-6 messenger ribonucleic acid expression was a significant predictor of smaller left hippocampal volume (Mondelli et al., 2011).||Several other lines of evidence provide a theoretical background for targeting IL-6 in schizophrenia. Polymorphisms of the gene for IL-6 (Paul-Samojedny et al., 2010) and its receptor (Sun et al., 2008) have been associated with schizophrenia. In mice, a single maternal injection of IL-6 during pregnancy caused prepulse and latent inhibition deficits in the adult offspring (Smith et al., 2007). Prenatal maternal infections are a replicated risk factor for schizophrenia (Brown and Derkits, 2010). In a rat prenatal immune activation model, adult offspring have increased serum IL-6 levels, at an age with homology to the usual age of onset of schizophrenia, that are significantly decreased following treatment with haloperidol (Romero et al., 2007; Romero et al., 2010). Another animal study found that ketamine-induced neuronal production of IL-6 is responsible for the activation of brain NADPH-oxidase and subsequent dysfunction of fast-spiking parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (Behrens et al., 2008). These findings provide further support for a potential role of IL-6 in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.||In our Preliminary Study, patients with schizophrenia, age 18-70 and taking non-clozapine antipsychotics, had a fasting blood draw for serum cytokines, and assessment of psychopathology, including cognition. Subjects were not taking NSAIDs, and had no history of immune disorders, illicit drug use in the past month, or antibiotic use in the past 2 weeks. In 39 patients, after controlling for potential confounding effects of age, sex, race, smoking, BMI, socioeconomic status, serum cortisol, psychotropic medications, intelligence quotient, and severity of psychopathology, higher serum IL-6 levels predicted greater cognitive impairment, measured by the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS) composite score, in a linear regression model (p=0.002, Figure 1). Higher IL-6 levels were also associated with significantly lower scores on the Verbal Memory (r=-0.40, p<0.01) and Motor Speed (r=-0.42, p<0.01) subtests of the BACS.||In the first year, one clinical trial is planned. We will conduct an 8-week open-label trial to determine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of tocilizumab as an adjunct to antipsychotic medications in 10 stable outpatients with schizophrenia.||Tocilizumab has not been used before in the treatment of schizophrenia, and using it this way is experimental. The risks that have been found in people with rheumatoid arthritis are known, but there may be unknown risks when used in schizophrenia. Clinically significant adverse drug reactions include anaphylaxis (0.4%), infections (0.1-7.8%), intestinal perforation, neutropenia (7.0%), and cardiac failure. Known side effects of tocilizumab that are common include: increase in hepatic enzymes (AST, ALT), hypertension, headache, neutropenia, infusion-related reactions, upper respiratory tract infections, and nasopharyngitis.||Less common side effects include: peripheral edema, dizziness, rash, increased total cholesterol and LDL, hypothyroidism, diarrhea, abdominal pain, mouth ulcerations, gastric ulcer, stomatitis, weight gain, gastritis, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, increased bilirubin, conjunctivitis, nephrolithiasis, bronchitis, cough, dyspnea, herpes simplex. Rare side effects include: cellulitis, fungal infections, diverticulitis, gastroenteritis, herpes zoster, hypertriglyceridemia, malignancy (including breast and colon), multiple sclerosis, otitis media, pneumonia, sepsis, tuberculosis, urinary tract infections, and varicella.||Subjects with schizophrenia will be accessed from outpatient psychiatry clinic at Georgia Health Sciences University or other satellite collaborative sites. The study has 5 visits: screening, baseline, and 2, 4, and 8 weeks. At Screening, all subjects will be administered the evaluation to sign consent, informed consent, and the structured clinical interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual psychosis and affective disorders modules. We will perform a medical history and physical exam, fasting labs (CBC, Complete Metabolic Panel, lipid panel, urinalysis, and urine drug screen (UDS)), a tuberculin skin test, and a 12-lead electrocardiogram. At Baseline, we will perform the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, BACS, and Clinical Global Impressions scale (CGI), and draw blood for IL-6 and high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hsCRP). All subjects will receive a 4 mg/kg infusion of tocilizumab, the recommended starting dose for adults with rheumatoid arthritis. We will contact the subjects by phone on day 1 and 7 after the infusion to assess for any infusion-related events. At Week 2 and 4, we will perform an interval history, physical exam, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, BACS, and CGI. Different versions of the BACS will be used to avoid practice effects. At Week 4, we will obtain fasting labs (CBC, Complete Metabolic Panel, lipid panel, IL-6, hsCRP, and UDS), and subjects will receive a 4 mg/kg infusion of tocilizumab, We will contact the subjects by phone day 1 and 7 after the second infusion to assess for any infusion-related events. At Week 8, we will perform an interval history, physical exam, and administer the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, BACS, CGI, and obtain fasting labs (CBC, Complete Metabolic Panel, lipid panel, IL-6, hsCRP, and UDS).

0	Attention Training to Modify Error-related Negativity and Risk for Anxiety in Adolescence, Approximately 600 youths between the ages of 11 and 14 and their parents will be assessed. Adolescents will be evaluated at baseline using event-related potentials, self-report, and interview-based measures. The error-related negativity will be evaluated immediately (it takes less than 5 minutes to process and score a single subjects' error-related negativity ), and adolescents with good error-related negativity data (~90%, based on scorable error-related negativity data) will be randomly assigned to either an 8-week (i.e., 16 session) adaptive attention bias modification (N=180) or control condition (N=180) or a waitlist condition (N=180) group. Each session lasts 20 minutes, and participants will be asked to complete two 20-minute sessions per week. Participants will be assessed immediately at post, using the same measures from the baseline assessment. All participants will complete a 2-year follow-up lab visit using the same measures from the baseline assessment., 0
2	Atypical Antipsychotic Treatment Effect On Brain Function In Schizophrenia Measured By FMRI, The general aim of this study was to determine the neuroanatomic basis for cognitive pathology in schizophrenia, as well as the effects of treatment with typical and atypical antipsychotics on clinical symptoms, neurocognition and brain function, as measured with function magnetic resonance imaging. Subjects underwent a randomized parallel group treatment trial that consisted of: a four-week Thiothixene treatment period, followed by randomization, two-weeks cross titration, and six-weeks of double blind treatment with Risperidone (RIS) or Olanzapine (OLZ). Twenty-three patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and fifteen healthy control subjects were initially enrolled. Diagnosis was established with the SCID. Subjects were assessed at two time points, at baseline after four weeks of Thiothixene treatment and at follow up, after eight weeks of double-blind atypical antipsychotic treatment. Controls were assessed once. Symptom severity was assessed using the PANSS. Cognitive functions associated with frontal and temporal cortical regions were probed with a neurocognitive testing battery using standardized attention, executive function and working memory tasks. Frontal and temporal cortical function was assessed with fMRI during the performance of visual and auditory oddball tasks. The visual task oddball task consisted of identifying an infrequent square presented within a series of frequent squares. The auditory oddball task consisted of identifying an infrequent pitch-deviant target tone embedded within a series of frequent standard tones. Thirteen patients and eleven controls completed fMRI at baseline and follow-up.||The results indicated that patients treated with the typical neuroleptic Thiothixene showed significantly smaller extents of activations in superior temporal, anterior cingulate and thalamic regions as compared to control subjects during the auditory oddball task. Although treatment with atypical neuroleptics considerably reduced group differences in cortical activation between controls and patients, the current sample size proved to be insufficient to yield statistically significant group by time interactions. The percent signal change data was in the same direction, but proved to be less sensitive to group differences than the extent of activation. The group differences were not pronounced during the visual oddball task, but were in the same direction., 0

2	A Multicenter Study of NAP (AL-108) in Schizophrenia, Background||AL-108 is an intranasal drug product containing NAP, an 8 amino-acid peptide (Asn-Ala-Pro-Val-Ser-Ile-Pro-Gln; NAPVSIPQ, MW=824.9) fragment of the much larger (approx. 124KD) Activity-Dependent Neuroprotective Protein (ADNP), which participates in neurodevelopment and neuroprotection. In mice, ADNP knockouts are lethal exhibiting CNS dysgenesis. ADNP mediates its effects in part through interaction with microtubules. Because of its large size, ADNP is assumed to not penetrate the BBB and thus cannot be used pharmacologically. NAP was chosen because it represents the epitope most associated with microtubule interaction and neuroprotection. NAP is absorbed following IV or intranasal administration, and has been shown to cross the BBB.||Rationale for NAP treatment: tubulin function in brain function||The cytoskeleton plays a key role in maintaining the highly asymmetrical shape and structural polarity of neurons that are essential for neuronal physiology. The cytoskeleton is made up of microfilaments, intermediate filaments and microtubules. Microfilaments (4-9 nm diameter) are made up of actin monomers and they function mainly to provide mechanical support and locomotion to the cell. Intermediate filaments are cytoplasmic fibers of ~10nm diameter. They provide supporting framework within the cell. Microtubules (~24nm diameter) consist of tubulin and microtubule associate proteins. They function to transport nutrients and chemical messengers along the cell. Neurofibrillary tangles are twisted bundles of neurofibrils formed when the microtubule-associated protein, tau, dissociates from microtubules and clusters to form an insoluble mass. Under normal conditions tau binds to microtubules, stabilizing neuronal structure and integrity.||Hyperphosphorylation of tau is assumed to be the cause for the formation of neurofibrillary tangles. Although neurofibrillary tangles are most associated with cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimers disease, some increase in neurofibrillary pathology has also been reported in schizophrenia, potentially as consequence of antipsychotic medication (1). Thus, mechanisms underlying microtubular function may be relevant to schizophrenia as well. In association with tubulin polymerization into microtubules, NAP influences tau dynamics by increasing the ratio of non-phosphorylated tau to phosphorylated tau, implying a dynamic process of cellular maintenance of the microtubular network, which is essential for the survival of the cell.||In brain, tubulin frameworks are stabilized by recently described STOP proteins (2) (aka MAP6). Linkages to allelic variation in STOP genes has been reported in schizophrenia, along with altered STOP protein expression in some brain regions (3). STOP knockdown mice show disturbances in dopaminergic neurotransmission (4) along with deficits in PPI and hypermotility that were partially reversed with clozapine (5). Thus, neuropathological features of schizophrenia may be due, in part, to abnormal STOP-related stabilization of microtubular structure, and NAP may stabilize STOP-related abnormal neurophysiological processes in schizophrenia., Cognition|Schizophrenia

1	A Controlled Trial of the Clinical Effects of Hyperbaric Therapy in Autistic Children, Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder currently affecting as many as 1 out of 166 children in the United States. Autism is considered by many to be a permanent, static condition with little hope for improvement. Treatment for autism is centered on special schooling and behavioral therapy; medical science currently has little to offer. Recent research has discovered that some autistic individuals have decreased cerebral perfusion, evidence of gastrointestinal and neuro-inflammation, increased markers of oxidative stress, and a relative mitochondrial dysfunction. Multiple independent single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) research studies have revealed hypoperfusion to several areas of the autistic brain, most notably the temporal regions and areas specifically related to language comprehension and auditory processing. Several studies show that diminished blood flow to these areas correlates with many of the clinical features associated with autism including repetitive, self-stimulatory and stereotypical behaviors, and impairments in communication, sensory perception, and social interaction. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) has been used with clinical success in several cerebral hypoperfusion syndromes including cerebral palsy, fetal alcohol syndrome, closed head injury, and stroke. HBOT can compensate for decreased blood flow by increasing the oxygen content of plasma and body tissues and can even normalize oxygen levels in ischemic tissue. In addition, animal studies have shown that HBOT has potent anti-inflammatory effects and reduces oxidative stress. Furthermore, recent evidence demonstrates that HBOT increases the production of mitochondria and mobilizes stem cells from human bone marrow, which may aid recovery in neurodegenerative diseases. Based upon these findings, it is hypothesized that HBOT will improve symptoms in autistic individuals.||Our recent retrospective case series demonstrated that HBOT may improve symptoms in autistic children. We recently completed a prospective pilot trial using HBOT in 18 children which demonstrated statistically significant clinical improvements in autistic children on several standardized scales. Most of the scales were parent-rated, although some were rated by teachers. However, parents were not blinded to the fact that their children received HBOT and evaluation of the children was through parent-rated scales, either of which could lead to bias. There was no placebo or control group. Therefore, the improvements found in this prospective study could have been due merely to chance or the natural development of the children. To determine if HBOT improves symptoms in autistic children, a double-blind controlled study is indicated., 0
2	Effects of Pilates Exercise Program in Patients With Schizophrenia, Pilates exercises developed by Joseph Pilates has an increasing popularity in last decades. Pilates supposed that the balance between body and mind is an important factor in achieving health and happiness. Pilates stimulates the mind and decreases mental strain. The basic principles of Pilates-based approach are concentration, control, centering, diaphragmatic breathing, lightness, precision, and relaxation. It also aims to enlighten the awareness of body by inducing mind control. The control of large group muscles with coordination and focusing on breathing may increase aerobic capacity, and further improves mental health. Heretofore, some researchers also reported that the holistic approach of Pilates-based training may provide physical and psychological improvements on human health, and various intensities benefit the quality of life, mental health, physical fitness levels, and body types. Pilates exercises are utilized with a wide range spectrum for many diseases' management and are particularly used also for mental health disease such as depression, anxiety, mood etc. The sample of the study consisted of patients who were diagnosed with schizophrenia according to The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). Current study was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration and its subsequent amendments. All the subjects volunteered to participate in this research and signed the informed consent form approved by the Institutional Clinical Research Ethics Committee (Protocol no: 2015-84-21/10). On receipt of a completed consent form, patients were assigned to Pilates exercise group (PEG) or control group (CG) based on their willingness., Pilates exercise
1	Pilot Study of the Effect of Hyperbaric Oxygen Treatment on Behavioral and Biomarker Measures in Children With Autism, During the study's 20-week duration, all children will receive Hyperbaric Oxygen Treatment (HBOT) for two eight-week sessions, with a four week session between. Therefore, all children will participate in the study for 20 weeks, and will receive HBOT for 16 weeks. This is an open label study. This means that there will not be a placebo group in the study. All study participants will receive the same treatment of HBOT in a hard shell chamber. Normal air contains about 24% oxygen at a pressure of about 1 atmosphere absolute (ATA). The chamber will contain 100 percent oxygen at a pressure of 1.5 ATA, which is equivalent to the pressure at a depth of 15 feet in sea water. Each subject will complete the first 40 treatments during one hour sessions on 5 separate days in each of the first 8 weeks. They will then take a 4-week break before they begin their next 40 treatments, which will also occur during one hour sessions on 5 separate days in each of the last 8 weeks. The entire study will last 20 weeks. The child's behavior will be measured and evaluated at the MIND Institute at the beginning of the study, at week 8, and at week 20., 0

2	"Molecular Genetic Study of Schizophrenia: Parent-Offspring Trios, Specific Aims We propose to collect genomic DNA and lymphoblast cell lines of a total of 150 families with the probands fulfilling the criteria of DSM-IV schizophrenia in three years. The first degree relatives of the probands, including parents (parent-offspring trios) and non-affected siblings, a total of about 3 to 6 subjects, will also be recruited in study. Adequate statistical power of molecular genetic studies is the great concern. For this concern, we will examine the probands and family members clinically by using the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies (DIGS) for diagnostic assessment, and using neuropsychological battery including sustain attention, executive function, verbal memory and general intelligence.||This specific aims of this project are: (1) to cooperate with this important Taiwan Genotyping Consortium proposed by the NHRI; (2) to detect major schizophrenia susceptibility genes which are related to the neuropsychological endophenotype; (3) to do further fine mapping on suggestive linkage chromosome regions to replicate previous linkage studies results using our previously-collected co-affected sib-pair family sample; and (4) to deposit the lymphoblast cell lines into NHRI Cell Bank serving as a national resource for basic research in Taiwan.||Background||1. Genetic Basis of Schizophrenia Most family studies confirm that schizophrenia and related disorders is a familial disorder and that the risk to first degree relatives of schizophrenic patients is approximately ten times the risk to relatives of controls. Twin studies have found concordance rates from 46%~53% for MZ twin pairs, and from 14%~15% for DZ twin pairs (Kendler KS 1983; Gottesman II 1993; Prescott and Gottesman II, 1993); thus provide strong evidence for an hereditary component to schizophrenia. However, the concordance rates in MZ twins is far from 100% , which also emphasizes the importance of environmental factors in the etiology of schizophrenia. The evidence of genetic contribution to the etiology of schizophrenia is further supported by adoption study. Adoption studies of schizophrenia have shown that when biological offspring of schizophrenic mothers were raised by adoptive parents, they showed higher rates of schizophrenia as adults, compared to control adoptees.||Segregation analyses indicate that multifactorial polygenic model, which posit a large, unspecified number of loci to combine additively in causing schizophrenia, better fit the observed patterns of schizophrenia in family studies than do single major locus model. It was suggested that several genes of small effect in epistasis might responsible for genetic etiology of schizophrenia.||The location of susceptibility gene of schizophrenia is still under active search using molecular genetic methods. This way of approach included linkage analysis, candidate genes association study, and positional candidate gene approach, there is no a priori hypothesis that would lead one to focus on any given chromosomal region. Thus, the whole genome needs to be systemically screened. A few genome-wide scans of schizophrenia have been published for the decade and many chromosome regions showed suggestive evidences for linkage, including chromosome 1q21-q22, 1q31-q42, 2p22-q21, 4q24-q32, 6p24-p22, 6q16-q23, 8p24-p21, 10p14-p13, 13q14-q32, 15q13-q14, 22q11-q13. However, only a few chromosome regions were ever reported to have genome-wide significant linkage evidences, including chromosome 1q21-q22, 6p24-p22, 8p21 and 13q32.||Candidate genes studies revealed inconsistent results in the past decade. Neurotransmitter related genes, such as dopamine (D1, D2, D3, D4, D5), serotonin, r-aminobutyric acid and Glutamate receptor genes had been studied using both association and linkage studies and no consistent results obtained. Neuron growth related genes, phospholipase genes, and a potassium channel gene (hKCa3/KCNN3) have been reported association with schizophrenia. The hypothesis about the pathophysiological mechanism of schizophrenia provide the probable candidate genes approach in the molecular genetic study. There exists two issues to be resolved for candidate gene approach using case-control design. Firstly, a critical issue in assessing the significance of association with phenotypic measures is the likelihood of type I errors. Since many genes and phenotypes can be evaluated for schizophrenia, the significance level needs to be adjusted due to the low prior probability and multiple testing. Secondly, the effects of different population admixture between cases and controls may inflate the type I errors Positional candidate gene approach using linkage dysequilibrium strategy may resolve the above two problems raised by the approach of candidate gene association study basing upon the previous linkage results to increase the prior probability and using parent-offspring trios as internal control. This approach is more powerful than linkage study to locate the susceptibility genes of complex disorder as schizophrenia. With the fine mapping linkage evidences, the whole genome sequence and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) map, and the advancing microarray technique available, this approach is more efficient to locate the susceptibility genes of schizophrenia. Recently, a study using above strategy has been reported significant linkage dysequilibrium evidence of schizophrenia to a microsatellite polymorphism and a SNP of a gene, NOTCH4 gene, at chromosome 6p21.||Considering the potentials of positional candidate gene approach using linkage dysequilibrium strategies, we propose to collect parent-offspring trios of schizophrenia as the sample of further molecular genetic study of schizophrenia. With our previous and ongoing efforts in linkage studies of schizophrenia using co-affected sib-pairs of schizophrenia (see preliminary results), this sample can be used for further positional candidate gene studies.||3. Neuropsychological Deficit in Schizophrenia In the domain of neuropsychology, schizophrenia have been shown to have unique pattern of impairments in central executive function, sustained attention and working memory were rather unique in schizophrenia and are suggestive of frontostriatal dysfunction. It was agreed by most researchers that neuropsychological impairments of schizophrenia were best demonstrated by comprehensive test batteries tapping on various neuropsychological process, rather than single, isolated test and at present, the impairments strongly suggested dysfunction of frontal-temporal-limbic circuit.||Among the neuropsychological deficits in schizophrenia, visual sustained attention measured by the Continuous Performance Test (CPT) and executive function measured by the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) were studied more thoroughly. Common features of the CPT are that participants must respond to predesignated targets among stimuli that are presented at a rapid fixed rate. The discrimination vigilance task of the CPT may consist of a single stimulus (CPT-X, single character or number as the target ) or two successive stimuli (CPT-AX, a character or number preceded by another character or number as the target). The difficulty level of the CPT can be raised further by blurring the stimuli (degraded CPT) or using a relative target (CPT-Identical Pairs Version or CPT-IP). The different CPT versions might tap on different components of sustained attention: the more difficult ones are stable vulnerability indicators, while the simpler ones might be mediating vulnerability indicators in schizophrenia. Among studies specifically examining the relationships between CPT performance indexes and clinical symptom dimensions, one of the most consistent findings is that CPT deficits are associated with negative symptoms. Many studies also found that poorer performance on the CPT were associated with thought disorder or disorganized symptoms.||Executive function deficits measured by WCST referred to abnormal function of prefrontal cortex. Deficits in WCST performance are enduring and core features of schizophrenia, and predict long term disability, independent of other cognitive deficits. Functional neuroimaging studies have found that the WCST activates the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and that the dopamimetic drugs improves performance on this task in patients with schizophrenia and enhance the signal to noise of the prefrontal physiological response.||Previous studies confirmed that deficits in sustained attention and executive function are specific to schizophrenia and related to schizophrenic pathophysiological process. The deficits have also been associated with genetic risk of schizophrenia and may serve as an endophenotype in genetic analysis in schizophrenia.||4. Endophenotype Approach in Molecular Genetic Studies of Schizophrenia To resolve the problems of insufficient power of genetic analyses and genetic heterogeneity of schizophrenia, an alternative strategy was advocated that the use of a specific neurobiological characteristic of the illness as an additional phenotype that might reflect more closely the effect of a single genetic alteration.||The visual sustained attention deficits as measured by CPT was an potential endophenotype of the genetic susceptibility to schizophrenia. CPT deficits were present not only in schizophrenia patients, but also in their non-psychotic relatives. Using data from 148 non-psychotic relatives and 345 community adults found that the recurrence risk ratio λwas greater than 15 for the undegraded CPT and greater than 30 for the degraded CPT.||The executive function deficits as measured by WCST may also serve as an endophenotype in genetic studies of schizophrenia. WCST deficits presented both in schizophrenic patients and their healthy siblings.||Thus, using CPT deficits and WCST deficits as endophenotypes of schizophrenia would provide a valuable measure of genetic risk, would improve the power of genetic analyses and may help identify susceptibility genes for schizophrenia.||This endophenotype strategy has been successful in mapping of a neurophysiological deficit of schizophrenia, decrease of P50 inhibition, to loci at chromosome 15q13-14, recently. The genome-wide linkage analysis of the P50 inhibition deficit in nine multiplex schizophrenia families found a significant lod score (Z = 5.30,  = 0) at a loci chromosome 15q14. When the clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia was used as the affected phenotype, the maximum lod score at the same marker was not statistically significant. The other neurobiological deficit, eye tracking dysfunction of schizophrenia has been mapped to chromosome 6p23-21 with the maximum multipoint lod score of 4.02. Again, while the clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia was used as the affected phenotype, the linkage result was non-significant.||In summary, with our preliminary studies in linkage analyses using co-affected sib-pairs of schizophrenia and neuropsychological deficits in schizophrenia, this project to collect schizophrenics of parent-offspring trios with well-defined neuropsychological endophenotypes, is considered to be one crucial project for searching the susceptibility genes of schizophrenia.||Preliminary Studies||Collection of Schizophrenia Co-affected Sibpairs Family The P.I. has been committed himself in collecting the schizophrenia co-affected sib-pairs family since 1990. With the awareness of the importance and critical necessity of diagnostic assessment, these probands, co-affected sib and available non-affected sib as well as the parents were assessed with a semi-structured psychiatrist diagnostic interview using diagnostic criteria of DSM-III-R and/or DSM-IV. Besides, under the evolutionary theoretical model of psychopathology, developmental data were also collected. All these clinical data and family-tree data were established in the data bank of the molecular genetic laboratory (DBMGL) in the Department of Psychiatry, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University under the auspice of the P.I. In total, there are around 120 schizophrenia co-affected sib-pairs families available for linkage analysis in the DBMGL. As a rule, the DNA samples were obtained from the peripheral white cells of all available subjects of the family, especially the co-affected sibs, at least one non-affected sib and the parents. In total, around 1000 DNA samples were in the DBMGL. Cell-lines of EBV-958 transformed lymphoblast cells were established too. All these study subjects were well informed for this study and informed consent obtained. All families participated in this study were invited to join a ""New-Hope Family Club"" for periodic meeting and discussion. Around 150 schizophrenia cases who received detail clinical assessment and regular follow-up and comprehensive neuropsychological assessment, including CPT, WCST, WAIS-R, and WMS, were recruited for obtaining DNA samples. Around 200 normal control subjects were also recruited for obtaining DNA samples.||The instruments used in genetic studies have been established. The Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Genetic Study (DIGS) and schizotypy interview schedule (SIS) were translated and modified to be useful in Taiwan subjects. The Perceptual aberration scale (PAS) and Schizotypal personality questionnaire (SPQ) were also used in community study on schizophrenia-related personality disorders. The cross-cultural consideration was employed.||A 5-year nation-wide collaborative work in Taiwan (Taiwan Schizophrenia Linkage Study, TSLS), sponsored by the NIMH, U.S.A., to collect families with co-affected sib-pairs with schizophrenia has been going on in the third years. A total of 600 families will be collected. DNA samples, cell-lines and clinical data of DIGS, FIGS, as well as neuropsychological testing data were collected. The DNA sample would be open to research teams all over the world.||Molecular Genetic Studies of Schizophrenia Our molecular genetic studies of schizophrenia were supported by three consecutive projects: the molecular genetic project sponsored by the National Science Council (1989-1992), the molecular genetic project of MPGRP (1993-1998) and the molecular genetic project of MPSS (1998-2001) sponsored by NHRI. The early phase (1989-1992) of this molecular genetic project focused on establishing laboratory facilities and collecting co-affected schizophrenic sib-pair families. The 2nd phase of this molecular genetic project (1993-1998) continued the collection of families, and the collection was extended to collect the co-affected bipolar sib-pairs, schizophrenic cases and normal controls. We found the polymorphism of androgen receptor gene of (CAG)n had a probable association with schizophrenia. This finding supported the finding of DeLisi et al. The molecular genetic methods of linkage analysis and candidate gene association were promoted, this laboratory of the P.I. (Dr. Hwu) moved to emphasize in this area too. The results of this laboratory were: (1) The polymorphism of (48bp) repeats in DRD4 receptor gene was not significantly linked with schizophrenia; (2) A single mutation in DRD2 was found not to be associated with schizophrenia (3) The samples of the data bank of this project had joined three international collaboration studies using positional cloning approach which need relatively large sample. The one is organized by Gill et al entitled as ""Schizophrenia Collaborative Linkage Group"", another was led by Dr. Moises in Kiel University, Germany and the third one is with Dr. Powell in London. All these results revealed the possible markers in chromosomes 6p, 11q, 13q, 19q and 22q. This suggests that Taiwanese patients may have possible susceptibility genes in these regions, except chromosome 13q, fitting an oligogenetic model. (4) The association study on 5-HT2 receptor gene located on chromosome 13q was found to be negative; (5) Clinical epidemiological analysis using co-affected sib-pairs demonstrated the tendency of 3 independent symptom clusters of reality disorganization, disorganization and negative state. (6) Weak linkage evidence to loci at chromosome 6p24-22.||The 3rd phase of the molecular genetic study (1998-2001) continued focusing at collecting co-affected schizophrenic sib-pair families and linkage analysis on reported suggestive evidences of chromosome regions, including chromosome 1q21-q22, 1q31-q42, 8p24-p21, 15q13-q14, 22q11-q14. The linkage results were (1) suggestive evidence of linkage for schizophrenia with and without the negative symptoms on chromosome 6p24 and 22q12 (2) no linkage evidence of GABAA receptor α1 (GABRA1) , β1 (GABRB1) andβ3 (GABAB3) subunit gene with schizophrenia (3) no linkage evidence of Glutamate GluR5 and GluR6 receptor gene with schizophrenia (4) no linkage evidence of SCA1 gene with schizophrenia (5) suggestive linkage evidence on markers of chromosome 8p with schizophrenia (Hwu et al., 2001a) (6) weak linkage evidence of markers of chromosome 1q31-42 with schizophrenia (7) suggestive linkage evidence of markers on 15q13-14 with schizophrenia (8) modest linkage evidence of schizophrenia to loci at chromosome 1q21-22. The candidate gene approach has revealed the following results: (1) possible association between Dopamine D4 receptor (DRD4) gene polymorphism with quick treatment response of schizophrenia (Liu et al., 2001d) . (2) no association between cytosolic phospholipase A2 (c-PLA2) gene polymorphism and schizophrenia.||Studies on Neuropsychological Deficits in Schizophrenia We found impaired sustained attention by continuous performance test (CPT) as the trait marker of schizophrenia. Family studies have indicated that sustained attention deficits as measured by the CPT are vulnerability markers of schizophrenia. The results are: (1) a substantial proportion of non-psychotic relatives of schizophrenia probands (19-34%) have CPT deficits, which can be predicted from their probands' CPT performance; (2) subjects with schizotypal personality features also exhibit CPT deficits, which are specifically associated with negative factors of schizotypy; (3) CPT deficits are present in schizophrenic patients, are particularly associated with negative and disorganized symptoms, and those with more difficult CPT versions are not amenable to neuroleptic treatment.||The specificity of CPT was studied in a group of schizophrenia patients (n=41) in contrast to the group of bipolar patients with psychotic symptoms (n=46) and the group of bipolar patients without psychotic symptoms (n=22) and a group of patients with non-psychotic major depressive disorder (n=22). It was found that CPT deficits are stable vulnerable indicators of schizophrenia, mediating vulnerability indicators for bipolar disorder, and state-dependent indicator for major depression. These results demonstrate that CPT deficits are valid trait marker of schizophrenia.||All these preliminary data support that the PI and his associates is capable in executing this project including collection of parent-offspring trios families, DNA extraction and cell culture laboratory techniques, and the neuropsychological assessment.||Research Design and Methods||1. Subjects We prepare to collect parent-offspring trios families from the Medical Center of National Taiwan University Hospital and the affiliated psychiatric hospitals, the Taoyuan Psychiatric Center. The proband cases to be recruited are the residents of the Northern part of Taiwan. Informed consent will be obtained before the recruitment for study. The first degree relatives to be recruited are the parents and at least one of the unaffected siblings. The diagnosis of the proband cases is of schizophrenia defined by DSM-IV criteria.||Clinical Assessment Measures I. The Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies (DIGS) All subjects will be personally interviewed with the DIGS, which was created by Tsuang and Faraone from the NIMH Human Genetics Initiative. The DIGS makes a detailed assessment of the course of illness, and makes a careful assessment of substance abuse and mood symptoms. This allows for an easier differential diagnosis between schizophrenia and substance related psychoses, schizoaffective disorders and psychotic mood disorders. This detailed assessment helps protect against false positive diagnosis.||In addition, the DIGS provides a rich description of many domains of psychopathology: somatization, major depression, mania/hypomania, dysthymia/depressive personality/hyperthymic personality, alcohol abuse disorders, pathological gambling, and antisocial personality disorder. It also collects self-reported demographic and medical history data. Ratings are also made on the Global Assessment Scale and the Scales for the Assessment of Positive and Negative Symptoms. Schizotypal and other Axis II Cluster A personality features are assessed by using a modified version of the Structured Interview for Schizotypy.||II. The Family Interview for Genetic Studies (FIGS) As an additional source of pedigree information, the FIGS will be conducted with all members of the family. This interview systematically questions an informant about the presence of psychiatric illness in relatives. We administer the FIGS in three steps. First, the structure of the family pedigree is drawn and reviewed with the informant. Next, psychiatric screening questions are asked about all relatives in the pedigree. Then based on the responses to the screening questions, one or more of five symptom checklists (depression, mania, substance abuse, psychosis, paranoid /schizoid/ schizotypal personality disorder) are completed for each first-degree relative, spouse, or other relative well known to the informant.||The DIGS and FIGS were translated into Chinese. The reliability and validity have been established in our preliminary studies.||III. The Diagnostic Procedure All diagnoses will be made using DSM-IV. These diagnoses will be made by two board certified psychiatrists with clinical and research experience in the diagnosis of psychotic patients. Final diagnoses of probands and relatives will be based on the content of the interview, the case vignette, information provided by relatives and a complete review of the medical record by each diagnostician. If the two diagnosticians disagree about any of the patient's diagnoses, a third diagnostician will be used as a tie-breaker.||IV. Training of Interviewers The training program will certify the interviewers: (1) establish a working knowledge of the diagnostic systems used in the DIGS and FIGS; (2) develop expertise in the administration and scoring of the structured diagnostic instrument; and (3) fully understand the process of informed consent and the need for strict adherence to consent procedures.||The training program is divided into two stages: (1) formal didactic training and (2) supervised experience using the structured diagnostic interview.||The didactic training begins with trainees reading and familiarizing themselves with the diagnostic systems used by the DIGS. This initial exposure is supplemented by lectures which review diagnostic criteria for all psychiatric disorders covered by the interview. Central issues addressed in these lectures are: (1) the importance of establishing diagnoses on the basis of objective behavioral description; (2) careful delineation and differentiation of syndromes which involve both psychotic and affective phenomena; and (3) clarification of major differences in syndrome definition among diagnostic systems.||The second component of training focuses on the structured diagnostic instruments. Trainees first gain familiarity with the structure of the interview. This is facilitated by having trainees conduct practice interviews in which they alternately play the roles of interviewer and subject. These initial interviews are conducted with a senior psychiatrist in attendance to identify problem areas in administration and to ensure clinically sensitive use of the interview.||The training program also includes a module on the modified Structured Interview for Schizotypy (SIS). The SIS training includes a review of the literature about schizotypal personality disorder, an orientation and review of the instrument, an opportunity for trainees to observe and make clinical ratings of a live interview, and a review and discussion of clinical ratings to clarify scoring criteria. All the training courses have been well established in our preliminary studies.||Neuropsychological Evaluations||Considering the complexity of the proposed neuropsychological deficits in schizophrenia, a test battery tapping multiple aspects of cerebral process is chosen to explore patients' overall pattern of neuropsychological deficits. The battery consists of tests supposed to measure:||Sustained attention (the Continuous Performance Test (CPT), both in undegraded and degraded test situations)|Central executive functions (Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST); Trail-making B);|Memory function (Weschler Memory Scale-third edition, WMS-III).|Test for general intellectual achievements (block design; picture completion; information; similarity; arithmetic; digit span; digit symbol substitution).||The neuropsychological test used in present study and validity of the test battery have been well established in our preliminary studies. We prepare to administer the neuropsychological test battery to the probands and all the recruited family members as possible. The neuropsychological test battery is rather time-consuming, estimated to take 3 to 4 hours to complete. Hence, the neuropsychological test battery will be administrated in divided sessions, completed in two days. Two master degree research assistants majored in psychology will perform all the tests.||2. Laboratory Work: This project has two lines of laboratory work||Collection of blood samples and extraction of DNA Twenty to thirty ml of venous blood will be obtained from all study subjects into purple top and green top vacutainer tubes. The blood sample in purple top tubes will be used for DNA extraction. We prepare to extract the DNA using a modified salting-out method.|Cell-line set-up All blood samples newly collected will have the lymphocyte transformed into lymphoblastic cell for preservation of cell-line which will be deposited into the cell bank of NHRI as the proposal requested. The detail procedures of cell culture established in our molecular genetic laboratory are listed as attached files molecular genetic study.||3. Data Management We have already set up the computerized DIGS database software in our previous study (Taiwan Schizophrenia Linkage Study, TSLS) and neuropsychological databank in another previous study (Multidimensional Psychopathological Study for Schizophrenia, MPSS). All the clinical and neuropsychological data in this project will be incorporated into these databanks.||The family pedigree data, DNA data, and cell culture data will be incorporated into our previously established databank: Bank of Molecular Genetic Laboratory Data (BMGLD). This BMGLD will include 4 sets of Data: (1) family tree and genotyping data bank. These data are set-up using the cyrillic program ; (2) DNA sample bank; (3) clinical data and endophenotype bank and (4) cell-line bank. This well organized BMGLD will be of great value for continous research work.||The data entry procedures will follow the guidelines that we use for our ongoing projects. These procedures seek to maximize the accuracy of data. The data will be double-entered, and the original and verification files will be compared for discrepancies. All datasets will be backed up to disc regularly. The backup and original data sets will be maintained in different locked offices.||The datasets in this project will be available to other investigators following the guidelines of the RFA. We will create a dataset which will include all data required by the RFA and whatever additional data the NHRI desires to incorporated into the Cell Bank. These data will be sent to the data management center designated by the NHRI for subsequent distribution to the member of genotyping consortium.||Anticipated Results We anticipate through this project to attain the following goals: (1) to cooperate with this important Taiwan Genotyping Consortium proposed by the NHRI, (2) to detect major schizophrenia susceptibility genes which are related to the neuropsychological endophenotype, (3) to do further fine mapping on suggestive linkage chromosome regions to replicate previous linkage studies results using our previously-collected co-affected sib-pair family sample, and (4) to deposit the lymphoblast cell lines into NHRI Cell Bank serving as a national resource for basic research in Taiwan.||Human Subjects This is a genetic study, all subjects recruited will present his signed informed consent before being enrolled for study. There is no invasive procedure of potential hazard in the process of the clinical interview and the neuropsychological evaluations. Blood samples of 30 c.c. will be drawn. This will be done using a needle and this may cause some painful sensation which is usually negligible in clinical setting. These participating subjects will be reassured as any discomfort feeling happens during the study procedures.||All researchers participated in this study procedure are all well trained. If these is any unexpected emotional or physical reaction happens during the study procedure, the P.I. of the project should be informed and necessary actions will be taken immediately. Since this is a genetic study, in the study procedure, there may have the genetic counseling issue raised. The participating researchers will be educated before attending this study for this topic of genetic counseling. These subjects or their family who are in need of specific genetic counseling will be refer to the special clinic, locating in the outpatient department of the National Taiwan University Hospital, of the P.I. of this project for special care.||Animal Investigation not involved.|Potential Hazards The clinical interview, the neuropsychological evaluations, and the blood sample drawn will be very safe. However, this genetic study might provoke some emotional reaction of the family, especially regarding the genetic heritability. In this case, the attending researchers, well trained, will give immediate assurance and assessment. If anything considered to be necessary, these subjects will be referred to the special clinic of the P.I. of this project for special psychiatric care.||The procedure of blood sample drawing might create mild degree of painful sensation or fearful feeling. These cases will be reassured immediately. Generally speaking, this study procedure is safe and the potential hazards is minimal and is manageable if anything happen., Schizophrenia|Niacin|Genotyping|candidate gene|one proband, normal parents and one normal sibling"
1	Pharmacogenomics in Autism Treatment, For this study, we will identify 40 children (4 to 18 years old) with autism who also have serious behavioral problems. We will then treat them with risperidone. Blood samples will be obtained prior to treatment and at eight weeks of treatment or study exit. At that time, efficacy will be assessed using the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale (CGI-I) and the Irritability subscale of the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC). Blood genomic profiles before and after risperidone treatment will be determined using Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarrays combined with RT-PCR.||Blood genomic profiles are shown to predict medication response for disorders such as cancer and epilepsy. This exploratory or discovery study will use blood genomic profiles before and after risperidone treatment in children with autism and severe behavioral difficulties to determine if the profiles can predict response to treatment. The ultimate goal of this line of research is to develop methods to predict which medications work for which child before initiating treatment, to predict which child might develop particular side effects, and to identify new treatment targets for future medication development.||Risperidone will be started at 0.5 mg at bedtime for 4 days and, if the current dosage is tolerated as evidenced by no more than mild sedation, no EPS or other moderate to severe AEs, and if there are continued behavioral symptoms, the dose will be increased to 1 mg at bedtime for an additional 4 days. If tolerated and indicated, 0.5 mg will be added in the AM for a daily total of 1.5 mg. After that, dosages may be increased if there does not appear to be an adequate clinical response. Dosage will not be increased if there are side effects (e.g. excessive sedation, salivation, EPS, lactation) and may be decreased if it is not tolerated. If the investigator determines that a significant adverse reaction occurs or if the subject or his or her family wants to stop the study, the medication will be tapered or stopped depending on the dose and reason for stopping and the subject will be offered alternative treatment at the M.I.N.D. Institute Clinic or referred elsewhere. This dosing schedule mirrors that used in the two recent positive trials of risperidone for treating severe behavioral problems in autism (McCracken et al., 2002; Shea et al., 2004)., 0

1	Fluvoxamine and Sertraline in Childhood Autism - Does SSRI Therapy Improve Behaviour and/or Mood?, Autism is a neuropsychiatric disorder diagnosed in early childhood. Approximately 10 Canadian children per 10 000 live births suffer from the disorder, which is three to four times more common in males than in females. It is characterized by social and and communicative deficits and restricted, repetitive interests and behaviours. Most autistic children are delayed in the acquisition of both verbal and non-verbal communication skills and many never develop useful language. Three-quarters of autistic children have mild to severe mental retardation and a quarter develop seizures during later childhood or adolescence. Its etiology is heterogenous and there is no cure. Although behaviour therapy is an important tool in management, pharmacotherapy remains a necessity for many children. Current therapy is limited to antipsychotic drugs that can carry an unacceptable risk of chronic neurotoxicity (tardive dyskinesia) or tricyclic antidepressants that have undesireble cardiovascular effects. This study proposes to evaluate the potential benefit of selective seratonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in autism.||All autistic children whose symptoms are not currently well controlled will be offered entry into the trial. Each child will randomized to eight weeks of fluvooxamine, sertraline, or placebo. If they do not improve on their initial dose, they may have a dose increase and continue in the study for a further eight weeks. Due to the significant amount of within- and between- patient variability, multiple baseline evaluations will be completed prior to the initiation of drug therapy. Parents may choose to continue therapy that was effective for their child; if their child was randomized to placebo, parents may choose to try an SSRI for a period of 8 weeks to assess effectiveness., autism|fluvoxamine|sertraline|selective seratonin reuptake inhibitors|paediatrics

2	"Schizophrenia, Related Troubles and Glutathione: Clinical Trial. Effects of Oral Administration of N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) on the Brain Glutathione Level and on the Symptoms of Schizophrenia, The results of the study ""schizophrenia, related disorders and glutathione"" conducted at the Laboratory of Psychiatric Neuroscience (LUNEP) DUPA of Lausanne, reinforce the hypothesis proposed that a deficit intracerebral glutathione is a vulnerability factor for Schizophrenia at least for a subgroup of patients. While pursuing the baseline study, it is appropriate now to try to restore a higher level of glutathione in patients to see if this increase is accompanied by an improvement in symptoms, particularly negative symptoms and disorders cognitive, particularly resistant to current therapy. N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) is a precursor of glutathione which is used clinically for various indications, well tolerated even at high doses. The investigators propose a double-blind cross-over with the aim to study if the N-acetyl-cystein (at a dose of oral 2g/day) leads on the one hand a rising glutathione brain (measured in resonance magnetic spectroscopic) and also improved patients' conditions (determined by clinical assessments, psychopathological, neuropsychological, biochemical and physiological), while recording any side effects. As a first step, this study should include at least thirty patients and last for two to three years.

2	A Safety and Effectiveness Study of Paliperidone Palmitate in Chinese Patients With Schizophrenia, This study is a single-group, open-label (name of study drug is known to patients), multicenter study to evaluate the safety and efficacy/treatment response of paliperidone palmitate administered for 25 weeks as once-monthly injections to Chinese patients with schizophrenia who previously received treatment with oral antipsychotic medications. A target of 353 patients (inpatients or outpatients) with schizophrenia will be enrolled in the study and will receive injections of study drug (paliperidone palmitate) on Days 1 and 8, and thereafter at a monthly flexible dose, based on patients' tolerability and/or efficacy. The study will consist of a screening period of up to 1 week before treatment, a 25-week treatment period, and a follow-up period approximately 30 days after the last injection of study drug. Upon meeting the entry criteria for the study, patients will receive a total of 8 intramuscular (IM) injections of paliperidone palmitate during the treatment period as follows: 150 mg equivalent (eq) on Day 1, 100 mg eq on Day 8, and subsequent monthly IM injections with a flexible dose range of 75-150 mg eq. If the patient reports any signs or symptoms of worsening of schizophrenia, the investigator may prescribe a rescue medication (quick-relief or fast-acting medications that usually work right away to relieve symptoms) such as lorazepam (an antianxiety drug) to control agitation, irritability, restlessness, and hostility. Safety will be monitored throughout the study., Schizophrenia|Paliperidone|Safety|Effectiveness|Chinese

1	Docosahexaenoic Acid in the Treatment of Autism, Autism is a neurodevelopmental disability with an increasing prevalence. Traditional medicine does not offer any cures for autism; thus, many parents of children with autism are attracted to complementary and alternative therapies, one of which is dietary supplementation with the long chain polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acid, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). DHA is a critical structural lipid of brain cell membranes and differences in brain DHA content may influence synaptic function, particularly in nutritionally-sensitive areas of the brain, such as the cerebellum and hippocampus, which may be brain structures involved in the etiology of autism. This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial investigating whether DHA supplementation is an effective treatment for children with autism. Eighty children with autism will be randomized to receive 200mg of DHA or placebo for 6 months. Outcome variables will include total plasma fatty acid patterns and scores on parent and investigator-completed behavioral and developmental rating scales at baseline and after 3 and 6 months of supplementation. Differences between groups after 6 months will be evaluated using regression methods. Regression analysis will be used to detect correlations between plasma total fatty acid DHA contents and scores on the various outcome measures. Results from this study will either provide evidence for a breakthrough biomedical treatment alternative for children with autism or evidenced-based advice to desperate parents in regard to their choices of potential treatments for their children with autism, autism|omega-3 fatty acids|docosahexaenoic acid

The probands and their siblings will also be assessed for other psychiatric disorders (K-SADS-E); autistic symptom dimensions (SRS, SCQ, CAST, ABC), other behavioral symptoms (CBCL, SNAP-IV), and perinatal/environmental risk factors. The direct tests include intelligence (CPM/SPM, WISC-III, WPPSI-R) and neuropsychological tests (CPT, WCST, CANTAB). The parents will be assessed for DSM-IV psychiatric disorders (ASRI-4) and autistic features (AQ, SRS). The investigators will collect blood samples from all the subjects. Probands with previous CNVs findings (n = 20) and high-functioning autism (n=30) will receive the MRI assessments (Diffusion Spectrum Imaging, resting-state fMRI) as compared to 50 age-, sex-, and handedness-matched neurotypicals.||The investigators will (1) characterize the behavioral, structural, electrophysiological and biochemical phenotypes of Dlgap2, and Arhgef10 mice at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks and 16 weeks of ages; (2) explore the possible function of other autism-related genes found by GWAS analysis; and (3) explore the possible drug targets for the treatment of autism from KO mice. While the potential target is recognized, existing compounds of this target can be tested.||The investigators anticipate to establishing a representative cohort of 800 patients with autism and their families from this study and [96HD008] with comprehensive clinical and genetic data. This well-characterized cohort will contribute to validation of intermediate phenotypes and cognitive and imaging endophenotypes for autism in this study, and will be used to search for rare variants by CNVs analysis and common variants by GWAS analysis in future study, and will pave the way to have 2-3 lines of well-characterized transgenic animal models of autism (e.g., Dlgap2). In addition, a wealth of data from this cohort will benefit to current and future investigation on autism and will be the basis for future international collaboration. The investigators also anticipated to publication of 20 SCI papers (4 per year) and presentation of our work in peer-reviewed scientific conferences by more than 40 posters or oral communications., autism|clinical phenotypes|neuropsychology|imaging endophenotypes|family-based cohort|knoutout mice

2	D-cycloserine Augmentation of Cognitive Remediation in Schizophrenia, D-cycloserine has been shown to enhance learning in animal models and, in a previous trial, once-weekly D-cycloserine improved negative symptoms in schizophrenia subjects. We set out to test whether DCS combined with cognitive remediation would improve learning of a practiced auditory discrimination task and whether gains would generalize to unpracticed cognitive tasks.||The proposed study consists of an 8-week, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group trial of D-cycloserine augmentation of cognitive remediation in schizophrenia outpatients. The primary outcome measure is change in performance on the MATRICS cognitive battery composite score after 8 weeks. Secondary outcome measures include a measure of processing speed assessed after weeks 1, 2, 4 & 8, and changes in negative symptoms and measures of functioning after 4 and 8 weeks. In addition, all outcome measures will be repeated at 6 months to assess persistence of benefit.||Hypotheses:||D-cycloserine will significantly improve cognitive performance as measured by the composite score on the MATRICS battery compared to placebo after 8 weeks of cognitive remediation.|D-cycloserine will significantly improve negative symptoms as measured by the SANS compared to placebo after 8 weeks when combined with cognitive remediation.|D-cycloserine will significantly improve measures of functioning (GAS, QoL and CGI) at 8 weeks compared to placebo when combined with cognitive remediation.|D-cycloserine effects on cognition, negative symptoms and functioning will persist compared to placebo when assessed at 6-month follow-up., Cognitive Impairment|Neuroplasticity|D-cycloserine|NMDA|Anti-Bacterial Agents|Mental Disorders|Psychotic Disorders|Antitubercular Agents|Schizophrenia and Disorders with Psychotic Features|Schizoaffective Disorder
2	Brain Activation Patterns in Schizophrenia After Computerized Cognitive Skills Training, Abnormalities in the domains of attention, working memory (WM) and information processing are important features of schizophrenia. There is growing literature that cognitive remediation therapy (CRT) can produce modest improvements in cognitive functioning in schizophrenia, suggesting that systematic efforts at improving cognitive functioning are feasible. Cognitive improvement after CRT may correlate with changes in brain activation patterns in specific areas.||After screening, patients are randomized to a 12 week trial of CRT using COGPACK (Marker Software), or to a 12-week control condition. All patients attend 3 weekly 1-hour laboratory sessions, with 1 discussion session per week.||Patients continue their antipsychotic treatment with a typical or atypical antipsychotic during the CRT and 4 weeks prior to enrollment in the study (Phase A). Following Phase A they receive baseline evaluations, including an cognitive activation task (N-back visual-letter task) while being scanned for fMRI , MATRICS neuropsychological test battery, and psychiatric, social functioning, and symptoms assessment.||Patients then enter Phase B with randomization to control or CRT for 12 weeks (36 laboratory sessions). Upon successful completion of 36 sessions, endpoint evaluations include an N-back task while fMRI scan, MATRICS, psychiatric, and social functional assessments.||All baseline and endpoint fMRI scans are conducted at the Center for Advanced Brain Imaging (CABI) at Nathan Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research., fMRI|working memory|schizophrenia|treatment refractory|cognitive skills training|dorsolateral prefrontal cortex|cognitive remediation|treatment refractory schizophrenia of > 5 years duration

1	Examination of Differential Valuation of Leisure Items and Attention as Reinforcers in Children With Autism, The three core features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are impairments in social interaction, restricted range of interest, and stereotyped/repetitive behavior. However, autism is a heterogeneous disorder, and individuals with a diagnosis vary widely in specific presentation. For example, despite an overall impairment in social behavior, some individuals with an autism diagnosis still frequently initiate social interactions with others. In contrast, others may engage in problem behaviors maintained by escape or avoidance of social interactions.||A progressive ratio (PR) assessment is one method for directly quantifying the degree to which an individual values a particular stimulus or event. Within a PR assessment, reinforcement occurs under schedule requirements that increase following each set of responses within a single session until responding ceases. The highest schedule requirement completed (i.e., breakpoint) can then be used as a measure of how much an individual is willing to respond for a given stimulus.||The study will include about 65 children, 25 children with ASD and 15 typically developing children, and 25 children with developmental disabilities other than ASD. Children with autism, typically developing children, and children with non-ASD developmental delays other than ASD will be compared in terms of how they value social attention and toys. The child participants will be asked to do an action, such as pressing a button, to receive either an item or attention. At first, the participants will only be required to do the action once, but after the first time the children will be required do more and more before they can get the item or attention. Eventually, most children stop responding for the preferred item or attention. The study will consider the child as done working when they go for one minute without performing the action. Sessions will end after 30 minutes if the child keeps working without stopping. This study will examine how many times the child will respond for items and attention. 15 of the children with ASD will be asked to come back for an additional appointment one week after they complete the assessment of how they value attention and toys. The PR assessment will be repeated see if the children respond the same way at different times.||The second part of the study will include 10 children diagnosed with ASD ranging in age from two to six. All of the procedures described in part one of the study will be included. The PR assessment will be completed prior to intervention and again after intervention. All appointments will be conducted over a maximum of 4 weeks. The intervention will be based on the principals of respondent conditioning; social interaction will be paired with the delivery of other reinforcers, such as edible items, to increase the value of social interaction. Sessions will be conducted 5 days per week and will be up to two hours long. Following the intervention, the participant will repeat the PR assessment in order to assess whether the intervention increased the value of social interaction., Autism Spectrum Disorder|Behavioral Research|Psychology|Cognitive Disorders
1	The Effect of Pilates on Muscle Strength, Balance Performance, Gross Motor Skills, Social Skills in Children With ASD, The purpose of this randomized controlled study was to determine the effects of Pilates Training by comparing the effects of Aerobic Training on muscle strength, balance performance, gross motor skills and social skills in children with autism.||As a result of this study Aerobic Training and Pilates Training are both effective in the improvement of balance performance and gross motor skills in children with autism, with more improvement in muscle strength in Aerobic Training. Pilates Training could be considered as an alternative training to increase physical activity in children with autism.||This study will answer whether pilates practice has an effect on Muscle Strength, Balance Performance, Gross Motor Skills and Social Skills in Children With Autism.||Demographic information of the participants was recorded.Muscle strength for shoulder flexors, hip flexors and knee extensors were performed with Hand-held dynamometry.The one-legged standing test was used to evaluate static balance performance.Test of Gross Motor Development (TGMT-2) was used to evaluate gross motor skills of participants.

1	Secretin for the Treatment of Autism, Autism is a disorder characterized by impairments of social interactions, verbal and nonverbal communication, and preoccupation with unusual activities or interests, particularly stereotyped or repetitive movements. This debilitating disorder is estimated to occur in 2 to 10 of every 10,000 births. A primary focus in pyschopharmacological intervention has been to treat specific associated symptoms, such as hyperactivity, aggressiveness, and temper tantrums; there are few pharmacologic treatments directed toward core autistic symptoms.||Secretin is a gut hormone with binding sites in the brain. Previous research has described three patients with autism who underwent diagnostic endoscopy for gastrointestinal complaints and experienced dramatic improvement in autistic symptoms following the administration of intravenous secretin given as part of endoscopy. Though the results of this single, uncontrolled study have limited interpretive value, many autistic children have been exposed and continue to be exposed to this potential treatment in an uncontrolled manner. This double blind, placebo-controlled trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of secretin for the treatment of autism.||Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: synthetic porcine secretin (sPS), biologically derived porcine secretin (bPS), or placebo. Each participant will be given an initial intravenous dose of 0.1 ml of their assigned treatment at the appropriate dose (0.2 ug for sPS and 1 CU for bPS). If no allergic reaction occurs within one minute, the participants will continue in the study and receive the full remaining dose over one minute. Participants will be evaluated one week before and four weeks after infusion for social, communication, and behavioral functioning as measured by Autistic Diagnostic Observation Schedule Generic (by blinded raters); Rimland Questionnaires (by parents and teachers); Expressive Vocabulary Test; MacArthur Communication Inventory (by parents and teachers); and Aberrant Behavior Checklist (by parents and teachers). Participants will also have a physical exam and blood and urine tests.

2	Cognitive Remediation Plus Aerobic Exercise in Schizophrenia Treatment, Cognitive remediation (CR) and physical exercise have separately shown promising results in schizophrenia cognitive improvement, despite this, the impact in improving functionality is still limited. Physical exercise increases Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) levels, promoting neuronal and cognitive plasticity, which can maximize the impact of CR. The aim of this project is to study the efficacy of an intensive program (3 months) that combines CR and physical exercise by a randomized controlled trial where 74 patients with chronic schizophrenia will be randomized to two groups: 1) CR plus physical exercise; 2) CR plus control activity (health promotion). Primary outcome measures will be cognitive performance, functional outcome, negative symptoms and BDNF levels. Measures will be blindly assessed at baseline, at 3 months follow up and at 15 months follow up. The investigators expect that: i) the CR plus physical exercise will be superior to CR plus control activity in improving cognition, functional outcome, negative symptoms and in increasing BDNF levels in the short and medium term (3 and 15 months); ii) changes in BDNF levels after the CR plus physical exercise will be an adequate biomarker of the cognitive improvement obtained with this treatment., 0

2	Do Antipsychotic Agents Induce Supersensitivity in Humans: A Combined PET/MRI Study in Patients With Schizophrenia, This project will study for the first time in humans, whether long-term treatment with antipsychotic agents, representing nowadays gold standard for patients with schizophrenia, may lead to an up regulation of dopamine D2-like receptors and associated, a supersensitivity of these receptors. The detection of such changes and the study of influencing factors (in particular smoking and type of medication) are most important for the understanding of relapse risks, development of treatment resistance and the risks for motor complications of antipsychotic pharmacotherapy. This monocentric, controlled study will include 140 participants over a time period of three years. 30 healthy volunteers, 20 first-episode, drug-naive patients with schizophrenia and 90 pretreated patients with schizophrenia will undergo a single PET/MR measurement., PET/MR|Dopaminergic supersensitivity|D2/3 receptor availability

2	Translational Investigation of the Glutamatergic and GABAergic System in Schizophrenia, The participant collective will include 3 groups of 200 persons, consisting of patients with schizophrenia, their healthy relatives and healthy controls that are not related to the patients. The patients must be diagnosed of schizophrenia according to DSM-5 to be included in the study and will be excluded when there is a further psychiatric comorbidity that dominates in the clinical appearance. All participants have to be aged from 18 to 80 years, be mentally and contractually capable to give their consent to study participation and may not be pregnant or have a structural neurological disease. The healthy participants must not suffer from a psychiatric disorder themselves and, additionally, the control subjects must not have psychiatric disorders in the family history of their first-degree relatives.||Every participant will undergo the same examinations, tests and measurements. All subjects will be taken a blood sample of 30 milliliters of blood that will be tested for antibodies against the NMDA receptor, neuronal growth factors, components of the glutamatergic and GABAergic metabolism and markers for the integrity of the blood brain barrier. In addition to that, a genetic analysis to identify risk alleles for schizophrenia and important glutamatergic and GABAergic genes will be performed. A medical history of every subject will be taken, including medication, somatic and psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, a row of psychiatric ratings scales as well as neuropsychological and neurological tests will be performed.||These will include||Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders (SCID)|Mini-RDoC|Short Form Health 36 (SF-36)|Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP)|Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale|Berner Psychopathologie-Skala|Calgary Depression Rating Scale for Schizophrenia|Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scales (CAARS)|Wender Utah Rating Scale (WURS-k)|Clinical Global Impression (CGI)|Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF)|Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (EPS)|Heidelberg Neurological Soft Signs Scale|Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia|d2 test||Every study participant must undergo an EEG measurement while different, neutral visual (fixation cross or movies without sound) and auditive stimuli (tones or clic trains) will be presented to them. They will be instructed to ignore the auditive stimuli. Resting state, auditory steady state response (ASSR) and two different auditory mismatch paradigms will be used. Without contradiction for the conduction of an MRI measurement, a combined EEG/ MRI measurement and a pure MRI measurement (without EEG) using the same paradigms are intended. It will also include structural (T1, T2 and diffusion tensor imaging) MRI and MR spectroscopy of glutamate and GABA. All the previously mentioned examinations are planned to take place on the same day with an approximate expenditure of time of five hours. If necessary, the examinations may also take place on different days, providing that there will be a maximum of three weeks between the first and the last measurement. Except from the blood withdrawal, we intend repeating all the measurements for a second time. This repetition must take place at least one day and not later than three years after the first measurement. It will not be necessary to repeat the clinical and neuropsychological tests if the first testing does not date back more than 6 weeks. In a second part of the study, we want to generate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) from 15 participants of every study group. For this purpose, a further blood sample of 20 milliliters of blood must be taken. The participants of the second part of the study will be selected based on special genetic, EEG or fMRI characteristics revealed in the first part of the study if they agree to be contacted again., 0
1	Efficacy of Aripiprazole Versus Placebo in the Reduction of Aggressive and Aberrant Behavior in Autistic Children, Aripiprazole is an atypical antipsychotic medication which is currently approved for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults. Multiple clinical trials in both children and adults have shown the effectiveness in the treatment of autism with medications like Aripiprazole. This study aims at assessing the effect of aripiprazole vs. placebo treatment on symptoms of irritability and aggression associated with autism, as well as the effect on the global severity of child and adolescent autistic disorder. Children or adolescent outpatients, with age ranges from 5-17, will be enrolled into an 8-week placebo controlled, double blind treatment study. During the 8 weeks, patients will be monitored by the treating psychiatrist. Study assessments will be administered at designated time points., Aggression|Irritability|Global autism severity

1	Valproate Response in Aggressive Autistic Adolescents, Autism is a complex biological disorder that generally lasts throughout a person's life. It starts before age three and causes delays or problems with many different ways in which a person develops or grows. Some people with autism become very aggressive and can hurt others or themselves. This study will test the hypothesis that aggressive autistic adolescents will show a significantly greater response to valproate maintained at blood levels of 75-100 mcg/ml than to placebo. The study will also assess the safety of valproate in autistic adolescents. This represents the first double-blind study of valproate in mentally retarded/developmentally delayed populations.||Participants in this study will undergo DSM-IV evaluation, the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised and Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, and baseline blood tests. After baseline screening, all participants will be given a placebo for 1 week. Participants will then be randomized to receive either valproate or placebo for 8 weeks. Dosage adjustment according to blood levels drawn at the end of weeks 2 and 4 will be arranged with parents by a child psychiatrist without breaking the blind. The Aberrant Behavior Check-list-Community (ABC-C) irritability subscale will be the primary measure; the Overt Aggression Scale (OAS), ABC-C hyperactivity subscale, Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) problem severity, Self-Injurious Behavior Questionnaire (SIB-Q), and a valproate side effects checklist will be secondary measures., Adolescents
2	Safety and Effectiveness of D-serine in Schizophrenia, Schizophrenia is a life-long brain disorder affecting approximately 1 percent of Americans each year. Schizophrenia can be extremely disabling, causing people to hear voices, experience paranoia or hallucinations, believe that others are controlling their thoughts, and even fail at maintaining a job or caring for themselves. Current medications help to relieve most of these symptoms, but not all. Some people with schizophrenia still suffer from negative symptoms, such as difficulty with talking, expressing emotions, and motivation; they may also suffer from cognitive impairments, such as decreased concentration and memory loss. D-serine, an amino acid found within the body, activates brain cell receptors that appear to play a role in learning and memory. This study will determine whether adding a D-serine solution to a stable antipsychotic medication regimen will decrease negative symptoms in people with schizophrenia.||Participants in this open-label study will remain on their regular medication regimen for at least 2 weeks. During this time and before starting treatment, participants will be interviewed about their emotional problems, marital status, education, family background, employment history, and any drug or alcohol problems. Participants will also undergo a physical exam, an electrocardiogram (EKG), vital sign measurements, psychological tests, cognitive tasks, and an electroencephalogram (EEG). Participants will then begin 4 weeks of treatment with D-serine. In addition to participants' regular medication regimen, they will drink a D-serine powder mixed with water twice daily. Every 2 weeks, participants will undergo a physical exam and an interview about any changes in symptoms or emotional problems that they may be experiencing. Blood and urine samples will be taken throughout the study. After 4 weeks, participants will undergo an EKG, EEG, and the same psychological tests and cognitive tasks completed prior to treatment. A follow-up visit will occur 2 weeks post-treatment to monitor any changes in negative symptoms., Negative symptoms|NMDA|Glutamate|Glycine

1	Behavior, Neuropsychology, Neuroimage and Electrophysiology in Autistic Individuals With and Without CNVs, Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is a common severe, multi-factorial, highly heritable, clinically and genetically heterogeneous, life-long impairing childhood-onset neurodevelopmental disorder. Due to its high prevalence and severe lifelong impairment without effective prevention and pharmacological treatment, this disastrous disease has been prioritized for epidemiological, molecular genetic and biomarker studies in the world.||Specific aims:||To validate the structural and functional connectivity in fronto-temporal, and cortico-striato-thalamic circuitry as effective imaging endophenotypes by demonstrating the differences between ASD probands with CNVs findings (n=22) and their unaffected siblings (n=22), probands without CNVs and known genetic markers related to ASD (n=22) and their unaffected siblings (n=22), and matched neurotypicals (n=22 for each);|To validate the neuropsychological functioning (particularly set-shifting and executive function) as effective neuropsychological endophenotypes by demonstrating the differences among the six groups;|To validate the electrophysiological functioning assessed by ERP as effective neurophysiological endophenotypes by demonstrating the differences among the 6 groups; and|To correlate the data from structural and functional connectivity, neuropsychology, and electrophysiology involving altered brain functioning.||The investigators anticipate that probands with CNVs may have higher level of decreased structural and functional connectivity, impaired ERP and neuropsychological functioning than probands without CNVs. The alterations in the structural and functional connectivity, neurophysiological and neuropsychological functioning would be observed in the unaffected siblings as compared to neurotypical participants. If CNV in the probands is proved to be de novo mutation and their unaffected siblings did not have such results, the likelihood of different functioning between their unaffected siblings and neurotypical participants would be decreased. The genetic dosage (CNV, rare mutation with moderate to large clinical effect, versus multiple common variants with very small effects, with regards to unaffected siblings, and neurotypicals) is anticipated to pose the strongest effects on the microstructural integrity of white matter, followed by functional connectivity and electrophysiological function, and neuropsychological function with the least effect., 0
2	Perception of Facial Emotions in Schizophrenia and 22q11 Deletion Syndrome, Methods:||This study will be conducted using visual steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs). Visual SSVEPs are periodic neural electrophysiological activities that arise in response to fast periodic visual stimulation (FPVS). They will be recorded in response to the periodic presentation of faces, according to an oddball paradigm. While pictures of faces will appear at a 6 Hz rate, only 1 out of 5 will display an emotion, corresponding to a 1.2 Hz oddball frequency. Different emotions will be tested (happiness, sadness, anger, fear and disgust), displayed with different intensities (20%, 60%, 100%). SSVEPs at 6 Hz will reflect general visual mechanisms (in response to a mixture of low-level (i.e., contrast coding) and high-level (i.e., face detection) processes). Importantly, SSVEPs at 1.2 Hz will index the visual mechanisms specifically involved in facial expression perception and their sensitivity to emotion intensity. Both measures will help determine the underlying brain topographies.||Alongside, clinical and neuropsychological tests will be conducted. While the clinical tests will evaluate the severity of the symptoms, the neuropsychological tests will assess different features such as attention, memory, verbal and visuo-spatial abilities. The patients' scores will be linked with their cerebral activity in response to facial expressions.||Outcomes:||To better understand the impairment of facial emotion recognition in schizophrenia and 22q11.2DS and to improve its care., schizophrenia|Facial emotions

This psychedelic (hallucinogenic) drug can produce transformative or mystical experiences and insights that can help in anxiety reduction. This study will be a randomized, active placebo controlled,double-blind pilot study of the safety and efficacy of LSD-assisted psychotherapy as a way of reducing anxiety in people with potentially fatal illnesses. This study will examine whether two sessions of LSD-assisted psychotherapy scheduled two to four weeks apart will reduce anxiety and improve quality of life for people experiencing anxiety as a result of a potentially fatal illness.||Study subjects will receive either 200 or 20 mcg (micrograms) LSD during two day-long psychotherapy sessions scheduled two to four weeks apart. Subjects in this study will have a 66% of receiving the full dose of 200 mcg LSD, and they have a 33% chance of getting the active placebo dose of 20 mcg LSD. Neither the researchers nor the subject will know whether he got 200 or 20 mcg LSD. Upon participant agreement, all psychotherapy sessions will be recorded to audio and video.||The randomized part of the study will last three and a half months (14 weeks).||People who learn they got the active placebo dose of LSD during the randomized phase can go on to to take part in an ""open label"" study phase, where they will get the full dose of LSD during two day-long psychotherapy sessions scheduled two to four weeks apart. ""Open label"" means that they and the researchers will both be aware that they are getting the full dose of LSD.||Participants who received the full dose of LSD and took part in all study visits will be assessed for symptoms of anxiety and depression and quality of life 12 months after their final experimental session., Anxiety|quality of life|psychotherapy|potentially fatal illness|lysergic acid diethylamide"

1	Prebiotic Intervention for Autism Spectrum Disorders, Children with ASD have a higher incidence of dietary and/or bowel problems than typically developing children. it has been postulated that imbalances in the gut bacteria and/or metabolites present in the gut may be a contributing factor to these symptoms, with potentially bad (toxin-producing) bacteria colonising the gut. Certain carbohydrates (so-called 'prebiotics') are not digested by the human gut and they provide food for beneficial bacteria and thus they improve the composition by preventing the growth of bad bacteria. Individuals could therefore benefit from these safe and effective dietary interventions to maintain the healthy gut bacteria and overall health. This study is being carried out to establish the effect of one such prebiotic, called galactooligosaccharide (B-GOS) on the relative balance of gut bacteria and metabolites in children with ASD. The aim is to enrol 42 children, ages 5-10 with formal ASD diagnosis and with signed informed consent from their parents, into double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel study. The trial will last 10 weeks in total (2 weeks run in period, 6 weeks treatment and 2 weeks follow up). Children will be required to take food supplement daily during the treatment period and their parents will collect stool, saliva and urine samples. Various questionnaires will also be used for assessments. Children will not be required to make other extra changes to their diet, medication or lifestyle., 0
2	Imaging Cannabinoid CB1 Receptors in Schizophrenia, Schizophrenia is a debilitating mental disorder with a complex and multifactorial etiology. The exact pathophysiological mechanisms have remained elusive, but a large body of evidence points toward abnormalities in a number of brain neurotransmitter systems: dopamine, glutamate, and gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA). Pharmacological studies have shown that acute exposure to cannabis is able to induce psychotic symptoms in healthy individuals and exacerbate symptoms in patients with an established psychotic illness. In addition, epidemiological studies have established that cannabis use in early adolescence is associated with an increased risk of developing schizophrenia later in life. Together, this evidence suggests that the neural systems targeted by cannabis may be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.||The brain endocannabinoid (EC) system is a recently discovered brain neurotransmission system, which involves endogenous cannabinoid agents (ECs) that act upon specific receptors (CB1 and CB2). CB1 receptor is abundant in the human brain and acts as an inhibitory modulator of classical neurotransmitters. ECs and CB1 receptors appear to be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. EC levels are elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with schizophrenia, and post-mortem studies have shown increased density of radioligand binding to brain CB1 receptors. To what extent CB1 receptors are involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia in the living human brain is currently unknown. The lack of suitable methods to reliably quantify CB1 receptors in the living human brain have to date hindered the progress in this field.||In this protocol, we outline studies aiming at elucidating the role of CB1 receptors in schizophrenia by using positron emission tomography (PET) and the recently developed radiotracer for CB1 receptors, [18F]FMPEP-d(2). The aim of this project is to explore CB1 receptor abnormalities in human patients with schizophrenia. The primary hypothesis is that CB1 receptor density is increased in patients with schizophrenia in comparison with healthy subjects. Insight into the role of CB1 receptor function in schizophrenia may help guide future development of pharmacotherapies., CB1 Receptor|Schizophrenia|Positron Emission Tomography (PET)|Healthy Volunteers|HV
2	A Study of the Effectiveness and Safety of Galantamine Hydrobromide on Cognitive Impairment in Patients With Schizophrenia., Galantamine acts on acetylcholinesterase, and has been shown to effectively treat cognitive symptoms in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Previous cellular research of nicotinic receptors has shown promising results, and it is theorized that the nicotinic system of patients with schizophrenia may be abnormal and may play an important role in the cognitive symptoms associated with schizophrenia. It is also postulated that galantamine may improve neuropsychiatric symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, and apathy in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Atypical antipsychotic medications are effective treatment for schizophrenia patients but some symptoms remain. Therefore, galantamine may be a useful cotreatment for schizophrenia patients on atypical antipsychotic treatment. This is a pilot dose-ranging, randomized (patients are assigned different treatments based on chance), double-blind (neither the patient nor the physician knows whether drug or placebo is being taken, or at what dosage), placebo-controlled multicenter study that examines the effects of taking extended-release galantamine hydrobromide (16 or 24 mg once daily) or placebo on the effectiveness in reducing symptoms of schizophrenia patients who are already taking an atypical antipsychotic medication. The safety of combined treatment is also examined. Measures of effectiveness include the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) to measure neuropsychiatric symptoms of schizophrenia; the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale to measure change over the course of the study; the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS) for verbal memory and learning, working memory, motor function, attention, verbal fluency, and executive functioning; the Continuous Performance Test (CPT) for sustained attention and distractability; reaction time test (RTT) and finger tapping test (FTT) for psychomotor speed; Lexical and Semantic Fluency Test (LSFT) for language skills. As schizophrenia patients are a population with high nicotine use, and galantamine may act on nicotine receptors, blood levels of nicotine are also measured as varying nicotine levels could alter the effects of galantamine. The null hypothesis that there is no difference between the 2 groups (galantamine cotreatment and placebo) will be tested for each of the efficacy measurements (total PANSS, BACS, and CGI scores) at Week 8. Measures of safety include physical examinations, electrocardiograms (ECGs), clinical laboratory tests, measurement of plasma prolactin concentrations, pregnancy test for women, and incidence of adverse events. Adverse events that might be related to the medications are also monitored using the Simpson-Angus Extrapyramidal Side Effects Scale (SAS), the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS), and the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS). Extended-release galantamine hydrobromide or matching placebo capsules for once-daily dosing. Patients take 8 milligrams (mg) per day during Week 1, 16 mg per day during Week 2, and 16 mg or 24 mg per day (depending on randomization) during Weeks 3 to 8. Treatment groups are placebo capsule, 16 mg capsule, 24 mg capsule., Schizophrenia|cognitive impairment|galantamine|acetylcholinesterase inhibitors|antipsychotic drugs|BACS
0	Effect Of Musıc Therapy On Anxıety Levels In COVID-19 Pandemıc, Today, billions of people are struggling with the pandemic caused by the COVID-19 virus. The pandemic causes many psychosocial and mental health problems in humans. (Montano and Acebes 2020, Guo, Feng et al. 2020, Ostacoli, Cosmo et al. 2020, Carmassi, Foghi et al. 2020, Heitzman 2020, Sun, Sun et al. 2021, Yuan ,Gong et al. 2021, Taylor, Landry et al 2020 ). Many people have faced problems such as stress, depression and anxiety (Liu, Yang et al 2020). Compared to other segments of the society, health workers experience these problems more frequently and more severely. The reason for this is that healthcare professionals undertake the task of providing health care services to people infected with the virus, being together with patients, having close contact and meeting their health needs. This situation triggers the risk of contact with patients, fear of death, concerns about the health of themselves and their family members, and psychological problems (Aykurt and Aykurt 2020). Therefore, healthcare workers are considered to be a high-risk group in which the psychological consequences of COVID-19 are significant and persistent (Fiorillo and Gorwood 2020).||Studies in the literature have shown that healthcare workers experience severe anxiety due to COVID-19. (Yanez, Jahanshahi et al 2020, Sahebi, Nejati et al 2021, Lai, Ma et al 2019, Ataç, Sezerol et al 2020, Luo, Liu et al 2021).||It is very important to screen health workers who provide uninterrupted service in pandemic conditions in terms of anxiety and other psychological problems and to plan remedial interventions. In this context, music therapy, which is known as an effective method to reduce the anxiety level of individuals and reduce stress, comes to mind. Music therapy studies with healthcare professionals are limited in the literature. In this context, it is aimed that this study will contribute to filling this gap in the literature and creating a database., Music Therapy

2	Oxytocin as Adjunctive Therapy for Schizophrenia, The project has two main aims:||Aims of the cross-over study To assess the efficacy of intranasal OXT in reducing negative symptoms in patients with SZ (as evaluated with PANSS), in association with standard Second Generation Antipsychotics (SGA)treatment; recruited patients will be aged 18-45 years and will have a disorder duration of no longer than 10 years.|Aims of the neuropsychological assessment To use an Emotional Priming Paradigm (EPP) task to assess pre- and post-treatment change in the patients general cognitive and emotional status.||The investigators aim at treating a large sample size of patients with schizophrenia, consisting exclusively of patients with a limited disorder duration and rather young age, for a sufficiently long period of time. Our rationale for employing a longer treatment period than used in previous and on-going trials is to ascertain the possibility of a positive OXT dose-response relationship, which would be observable, however, with longer treatment exposure. Moreover, only patients with a disorder onset of 10 years or less will be enrolled.||They will then be standardized in terms of AP treatment and randomized to OXT or placebo for 8 months.||OXT is a hormone that is naturally present in the human body, and recent studies have suggested that patients with SZ show low levels of this neuropeptide. It is therefore hypothesized that the treatment proposed in this project might balance apparently lower OXT levels in these patients.||Finally, another innovative aspect of this project is the attention at ameliorating patients adherence to treatment by supporting them with a reminder program (automatic SMS will be sent every morning to remind patients the daily OXT self-administration) and involving a trustworthy caregiver who will be trained in OXT administration and will be asked to monitor the patient compliance by recording each self-administration on a written form., Schizophrenia|Oxytocin|RCT

2	Computerized Cognitive Training for Schizophrenia in Brazil, Cognitive impairments are important determinants of functional outcome in schizophrenia, which are inadequately treated by antipsychotic medication. Neuroplasticity based computerized cognitive trainings have been emerging for the last two decades and are an attempt to help patients with their cognitive impairments and global functioning.||The aim of this study is to perform a computerized cognitive training to improve attention, concentration, learning, clinical symptoms and quality of life in patients. The investigators are interested in testing the differential efficacy between a specific visual versus auditory computerized cognitive training and explore the biological markers that may be involved in these neuroplasticity based training processes.||The investigators will conduct a 40 hours computerized, adaptable, perception specific, cognitive training program in patients with schizophrenia. Patients will come for 1 hour, daily, and perform a visual or auditory training, or control games for about 2 months. Visual and auditory exercises are chosen to be the equivalent of one another and target cognitive domains such as divided attention, working memory and social cognition. Clinical, cognitive, emotional and biomarker data will be collected before the training, half way through, and after the training, to assess progress in several aspects of their functioning and biology.||The investigators hypothesize visual and auditory trainings will be effective as compared to the control games. They also expect that auditory training to be more efficient compared to the visual training because it targets sensory functions that are mostly impaired in schizophrenia, due to auditory hallucinations patients experience. The investigators also hypothesize that both trainings will improve clinical symptoms and quality of life. On a more exploratory analysis, the investigators expect to identify new biological markers of cognitive neuroplasticity, which they expect will differentiate visual and auditory paths., cognitive training
2	Treatment Response in Schizophrenia: Bridging Imaging and Postmortem Studies, Our past brain imaging and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) studies have contributed to the understanding of specific brain regions related to treatment response to antipsychotic drugs in schizophrenia. We have found that treatment response to antipsychotic medication is related to blood-flow patterns in specific regions (such as the ventral striatum, anterior cingulate cortex, and hippocampus). In addition, functional changes in these regions following one week of antipsychotic drug therapy are predictive of treatment response. Dr. Roberts, a neuroanatomist, has studied the post mortem (after death) brains of patients with schizophrenia while working in association with the Maryland Brain Collection. Her studies have indicated an increased number of dopaminergic synapses (that is, neurons that produce the neurotransmitter dopamine) in these regions in patients who were known to have had a favorable response to antipsychotic drug therapy. In addition, from this post-mortem work we know the number of glutamate synapses in these regions were significantly different between good treatment responders and poor responders.||From these studies we have hypothesized that in schizophrenia an over-abundance of dopamine in the ventral striatum interferes with normal functioning by limiting the transmission of glutamate. Putatively, antipsychotic medications may decrease the symptoms of schizophrenia by restoring glutamatergic activity in the ventral striatum and projected areas, such as the anterior cingulate cortex and hippocampus. We have hypothesized that those individuals responding favorably to antipsychotic drug therapy will display greater glutamate activity in the ventral striatum (due to dopamine blockade) and the other regions receiving glutamate projections. This should lead to restored neuronal functioning in good responders when compared to treatment resistant and poor responders to antipsychotic drug treatment. We will test this hypothesis using complementary imaging and postmortem studies yielding data that will permit the formulation of a comprehensive model for antipsychotic drug responses in subjects with severe mental illness.||Magnetic Resonance is a technique for probing atoms and molecules based upon their interaction with an external magnetic field. Magnetic Resonance does not use ionizing radiation. The most familiar example of this is Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Another application of Magnetic Resonance is called functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) allows us to measure the Blood Oxygenation Level-Dependent (BOLD) response, a measure of blood flow in the brain that is known to correlate with neuronal activity. Another application of Magnetic Resonance is Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS), which allows the measurements of specific metabolites such as N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), a measure of neuronal integrity, and Glutamate, which is involved in neurotransmission and metabolism. We will seek to replicate and extend our past Positron Emission Tomography (PET) findings with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) using cognitive tasks that are known to activate the hippocampus (Episodic memory task) and the anterior cingulate cortex (Stroop task). This aim will further seek to parse out the differential contribution of the hippocampus and the anterior cingulate cortex to treatment response. At the same time, N-acetylaspartate, a marker of neuronal integrity, and glutamate measurements obtained with magnetic resonance spectroscopy in the anterior cingulate cortex and hippocampus will directly probe in the living brain the relation between neuronal integrity, glutamate function, and treatment response. In parallel, the postmortem work of Dr. Roberts (UAB IRB exemption: NO70813001, IRB#F080306003) will concentrate on the study of the anterior cingulate cortex in post mortem brains of schizophrenic patients. These studies should allow the development of hypotheses about the pathophysiology of treatment response and provide a basis for the interpretation of functional imaging data. The overarching goal is to identify imaging markers that will predict treatment response, and to confirm or validate these biomarkers using anatomical studies of postmortem tissue. Early detection of drug response would yield specific treatment strategies that are tailored to the individual, thus improving both the quality of life of the patients and drastically reducing the costs associated with unsuccessful treatment strategies., schizophrenia|treatment response|risperidone|functional magnetic resonance|functional magnetic spectroscopy
2	Evaluation of Physical Activity, Physical Fitness, and Quality of Life in Patients With Schizophrenia, Mental health is defined (according to the World Health Organization) as a state of well-being in which a person can realize his/her abilities, coping with the normal stresses of life, and supporting society by working efficiently and productively. In other words, mental health is a dynamic internal balance that enables individuals to use their diversity of skills in harmony with the universal values of the society. For example, it is the flexibility and ability to cope with negative life experiences and social functioning and the harmonious connection between body and mind. To be more concrete, mental health includes different components of life, for example in terms of relationships, good relationships with friends and family, the ability to talk about feelings. Examples of leisure activities include taking up a hobby, exercising regularly, and routinely taking vacations. It is also important to maintain a lifestyle that consists of having a nutritious and regular diet, not smoking and using over-the-counter drugs, and achieving at least some goals in life.||Mental disorders involve a wide variety of problems. Mental disorders are often characterized by a combination of abnormal thoughts, behaviors, emotions, and relationships with other people. Mental disorders include: depression, drug use disorders, mental disabilities, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.||Schizophrenia is a chronic mental disorder characterized by the appearance of both positive symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions and negative symptoms such as apathy and withdrawal, repetition of cognitive skills and disorganization. The number of schizophrenic patients in the world is approximately 20 million and this number will continue to increase every year. According to a systematic review of general population studies, the lifetime median prevalence of schizophrenia in Turkey was found to be 8.9 per 1000 people. In addition, schizophrenia patients have irregular self-esteem, inability to maintain social relationships, deterioration in cognitive skills, and sedentary behaviors in their daily lives. Sedentary behavior in patients with schizophrenia will increase the risks of cardiovascular and obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus (especially type 2), cancer that can contribute greatly to death and disability. Therefore, it was found that patients with schizophrenia have a shorter life expectancy of 10-20 years compared to the general population.||It has been found that people with schizophrenia are less physically active and less physically fit than the general population. Physical activity means any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that results in energy expenditure. Exercise is a subset of physical activity, which is planned, structured and repetitive bodily movements performed to increase and maintain one or more aspects of physical fitness. Physical fitness can be defined as a set of independent qualities associated with the ability to perform physical activities. Components such as cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle strength, muscular endurance and flexibility are more related to health, while components such as coordination and whole-body balance are more related to the performance of physical activities.||There is an inverse relationship between sedentary behavior (related to time spent lying or sitting) and physical activity level in patients with schizophrenia. In addition, physical activity has a direct relationship with physical fitness and physical health in patients with schizophrenia. In addition, one study showed that poor physical activity level and poor physical fitness had a negative effect on the ability of schizophrenia participants to perform activities of daily living performance causes a decrease in the quality of life in these patients. According to the World Health Organization, quality of life is defined as individuals' perceptions of their position in life in the context of the value systems and culture in which they live and in relation to their goals, expectations, standards and concerns. Quality of life is a subjective, multidimensional term defined as a standard level for physical, emotional, material and social well-being.||Community Mental Health Centers are State institutions that provide treatment and rehabilitation services to patients with certain mental health diseases outside the hospital and within the scope of State Hospitals. Community Mental Health Centers (CMHC) were opened in 2011 by the Ministry of Health in Turkey. Patients diagnosed with serious chronic mental disorders such as depression, drug use-related disorders, mental disabilities, bipolar disorder and especially schizophrenia are treated. The aim of these centers is to improve functional recovery, physical activity level and quality of life and integrate it into daily life, society and business life. It consists of a very comprehensive team of different professionals, such as physicians, psychologists, social workers, and nurses.||Schizophrenic patients are treated in a community mental health center with a comprehensive treatment program. The content of the comprehensive rehabilitation program in community mental health centers includes: Psychosocial skills training / occupational treatments such as painting, music, and also these are done according to the patient's condition / psycho-education for patients and their families (information about the disease and treatment, methods of coping with symptoms are explained) training is provided on issues such as illness, crisis management of patients and their relatives), social skills training (patients who cannot participate in social life due to their illness are given training to gain the ability to reorganize human relations) and group treatment is provided for suitable patients.||Evaluation of physical activity levels, physical fitness, and quality of life of patients with schizophrenia is essential to confirm the effectiveness of treatments and care activities at CMHCs and to plan new therapeutic and rehabilitative activities. In one study, they found that the level of physical activity - physical fitness has a positive effect on psychiatric services and can improve the physical health outcomes of people with schizophrenia. They also reveal improvement in psychological and social outcomes in these patients. Therefore, physical activity level and physical fitness are critical parameters of the biopsychosocial approach in recovery-oriented mental health services. In conclusion, our study aims to decide on physical activity, physical fitness and quality of life levels among a group of patients with schizophrenia treated at CMHC and to evaluate the relationship between these three important treatment parameters.||The aim of this study is to evaluate schizophrenic patients who benefit from community mental health center services in terms of physical activity, physical fitness and quality of life. Therefore, given the importance of our study, our findings may contribute to the literature and improvement for mental health systems for people with psychotic disorders, especially schizophrenia. As a result of this study, an evaluation can be made in terms of physical activity, physical fitness and quality of life in schizophrenic patients who receive service from a community mental health center. According to this study, it will be possible to contribute to the effectiveness of treatments and care activities in CMHCs for patients with schizophrenia., Schizophrenia|Physical Activity|Physical fitness|Quality of life
2	"""Manual Dexterity and Oculomotor Control in Schizophrenia"", 1 - Scientific background and rational Use of sensory cues is essential for execution and correction of voluntary movements. The motor areas and their regulation is of special interest in patients with schizophrenia as there is clear evidence of motor abnormalities independent of the effects of antipsychotic medication, even before the onset of the disorder. Sensorimotor abnormalities have been proposed as a valid endophenotype in schizophrenia. Our global objective is to study and provide vulnerability markers for schizophrenia.||Control of manual dexterity will be assessed by a force sensor (Power Grip Manipulandum, PGM)|Oculomotor movements during behavioral task will be recorded using a video-oculography device|The involvement of cortical inhibition in this volitional inhibition task will be studied by neuronavigation guided TMS coupled to EMG recording||2 - Description of the project methodology There is strong evidence for schizophrenia being a neuro-developmental disorder (Rapoport et al., 2005). It has been shown, for many years, that patients with schizophrenia exhibit abnormal patterns of sensorimotor integration (Manschreck et al., 1982), which is the capacity to integrate different sensory stimuli into appropriate motor actions. It is clinically relevant, in terms of early diagnosis and prevention, whether deficient sensorimotor integration is present in the prodromal phase of schizophrenia, and whether this constitutes a vulnerability marker for the disease.||Our global objective is to study the interactions and related substratum of oculomotor movements during force control task.||The secondary objectives:||(i) To show that increased motor noise is indeed present in schizophrenia. (ii) To show by TMS that cortical excitability in the primary motor cortex (M1) is task-modulated and decreased in schizophrenia.||(iii) Assess the role of deficient cortical inhibition in these behavioral deficits To this end, three different groups of subjects will be studied: schizophrenic patients, non-affected siblings, ultra high risk patients, non-treated schizophrenic patients and healthy control subjects., Sensorimotor Integration|Schizophrenia|TMS|Oculomotor|Motor Control"

Washout may be extended up to a maximum of 21 days depending on the participant's availability.||Follow up: Participants will return to the clinical unit for an End of Study Visit (ESV) on day 28 of period 2 or, if the participant terminated early from the study, 14 days after the last dose of study drug., Schizophrenia|ASP6981|Safety|Phase 1
2	Mental Health During the Whole Life Cycle of Community Patients With Schizophrenia, Schizophrenia is one of the components of severe mental disorders. It has the characteristics of prolonged course, low cure rate, high recurrence rate and high disability rate. It brings many short-term and long-term effects to individuals, families and society.Studies on patients with schizophrenia mainly focus on cross-sectional and case-control studies, but there is a lack of long-term follow-up of patients with schizophrenia in the community. Therefore, this study would establish a cohort study to solve the chronological relationship between exposure and effect, focus on community schizophrenia, and establish a community schizophrenia patient biobank that has been tracked for a long time from diagnosis.||Aim of the study:||1.1 Based on previous studies, this study will focus on patients with schizophrenia in the community. Establishing a biobank of new cases to monitor the occurrence of disease recurrences, violent behaviours and other outcome events during the whole life cycle of schizophrenia patients. Exploring the predictive effects of biological, psychosocial, imaging and other indicators on patient recurrence and other events.||1.2 At the same time, establishing a sample database of patients with schizophrenia in the community to lay a working foundation and reserve sample resources for subsequent related mechanism research, drug research, and intervention research.||Content of the study 2.1 At least 1,200 patients with schizophrenia diagnosed within three years will be recruited. On the basis of community follow-up and health examination, this study will expand biological sample collection and professional scale evaluation, establish a schizophrenia community cohort.||2.2 Based on the establishment of the cohort, this study will carry out statistical description according to the type of data. The differences will be compared between the exposed group and the unexposed group in demographic information, family and past disease history, personal living habits, condition and treatment, psychological evaluation, social support evaluation, sleep quality, functional evaluation, quality of life and other content. Repeated measures analysis of variance will be used to compare the differences in blood pressure, blood glucose and other indicators between the exposed group and the unexposed group. The generalized estimating equation will be used to analyze the relationship between the outcome of recurrence and emergency about physical activity, related biochemical indicators, and social support. On the basis of statistical results, this study will carry out research on the prognostic factors and related physiological mechanisms of schizophrenia.||Study design 3.1 Pay attention to multiple prognostic outcomes such as relapse, dangerous behaviours, suicide and self-harm, calculate the included sample size based on this. After the start of the project, in Hongkou, Jinshan, Minhang, and Xuhui districts, all schizophrenic patients in management who meet the inclusion criteria will be continuously included in the district.||3.2 At baseline, the patient's demographic information and a complete health history (include personal history, family history, and medical history) will be taken. The questionnaire survey includes the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS)，the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)，the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Screener (GAD-7), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) , the WHO Quality of Life Scale-Brief (WHOQOL-BREF) , the Modified Overt Aggression Scale (MOAS), the 10-item social disability screening schedule (SDSS) and the Perceived social support scale(PSSS),etc. Within six months of the completion of the baseline survey, the district-level mental health center arranges for patients in the district to participate in physical examinations. All measures will be administered at baseline and 12, 24 and 36 months follow-up except for the health history and PSSS, which will be administered only at baseline. Besides, the study will focus on the patients' recurrence events, violent behavior, various impacts on society and family, emergency response events, and prognosis by carrying out active follow-up every three months., Schizophrenia|Cohort study|The whole life cycle|Mental health

Criteria for entry into the study included: a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder-4 diagnosis of schizophrenia as confirmed by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview for DSM-IV (MINI); age between 18 and 65; being clinically stable (i.e. not having required hospitalization or increases in medication as a result of an exacerbation of acute symptoms over the previous three months.||All subjects completed a set of ""paper and pencil"" standardized assessments at pre-intervention and immediately after the end of the intervention.||Trait and State anxiety was assessed using the French version of the Spielberger State-Trait-Anxiety Inventory (S-STAI).||Three questionnaires were used in order to evaluate the outcomes quality of life of patients. 1/ The Positive And Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS); 2/ Patient's body/mind perceptions were assessed using mindfulness concept (Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory, FMI), and 3/ Patients' quality of life was evaluated using the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (WEMWBS).||One questionnaire was used to assess how patients deal with stress and stressors (the Derogatis Stress Profile, DSP)., 0"
2	Valproate in Late Life Schizophrenia, It is known that up to 30% of individuals with schizophrenia continue to have symptoms even when treated with current FDA-approved medications intended to treat their schizophrenia. Anticonvulsant medications such as valproate (Depakote and Depakote ER) are known to be effective for related conditions such as bipolar disorder (manic depressive illness), and are also used by some physicians in clinical settings in combination with antipsychotic medications to treat symptoms of schizophrenia. Currently Depakote and Depakote ER are approved by the FDA to treat bipolar disorder and to treat seizure disorder. This study will test to see if Depakote and Depakote ER may improve symptoms of schizophrenia as well when added to antipsychotic medications., Schizophrenia|Anticonvulsants|Valproic Acid|Valproate

2	Trial Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of 2 Fixed Doses of Paliperidone Extended-Release (ER) Tablets in the Treatment of Adult Patients With Schizophrenia, Paliperidone is being developed as a new therapeutic agent for the treatment of schizophrenia. The extended-release (ER) formulation of paliperidone was developed to deliver paliperidone at a relatively constant rate over a 24-hour period to improve the tolerability profile and decrease the potential for orthostatic hypotension. This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of 2 fixed dosages of paliperidone ER compared with placebo in adult patients with schizophrenia. This is a multicenter, double-blind (neither the patient nor the physician will know if placebo or drug is being given and at what dose), randomized (patients will be assigned to different treatment groups based solely on chance), placebo- and active-controlled, parallel-group, dose-response study. Patients will be randomized into 1 of 4 treatment groups to receive oral dosages of paliperidone ER 6 mg or 12 mg, olanzapine 10 mg, or placebo once daily for a 6-week period. The study includes a screening period of up to 5 days, followed by 6-week double-blind treatment phase. Following the double-blind treatment phase, eligible patients (those who have completed the 6-week double-blind phase or who discontinue due to lack of efficacy after a minimum of 21 days) may enter a 52-week open-label extension phase with paliperidone ER monotherapy. While patients are hospitalized, efficacy will be assessed twice during the first week and at the end of the second week, and after patients are discharged from the hospital, they will return to have efficacy and safety assessments performed on a weekly basis through the end of the 6-week double-blind phase. Efficacy will be evaluated throughout the 6-week double-blind phase by completion of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Clinical Global Impression Scale - Severity (CGI-S), Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP), Schizophrenia Quality of Life Scale, Revision 4 (SQLS-R4), and Sleep Visual Analog Scale (VAS). The efficacy response will be measured by the change from baseline score to end of double-blind phase for PANSS, PSP, CGI-S, SQLS-R4, and Sleep VAS. Safety will be monitored throughout the study and includes assessments of the incidence of adverse events; measurement of extrapyramidal symptoms using 3 rating scales (Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale [AIMS], Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale [BARS], Simpson-Angus Rating Scale [SAS]); measurement of vital signs (laying down and standing blood pressure, pulse, temperature); electrocardiograms; and clinical laboratory tests. Double-blind: 6 mg or 12 mg fixed dose of paliperidone ER, olanzapine 10 mg or matching placebo taken orally once daily for 6 weeks.||Open-label extension: start on paliperidone ER 9 mg taken orally once daily; maintained on a flexible dosage of paliperidone ER (3, 6, 9, or 12 mg/day) for 52 weeks., Schizophrenia|Paliperidone
0	School-based Interventions for Test Anxiety in Adolescents, Test anxiety affects a substantial proportion of adolescents, who show an increased risk of suicide, and of developing clinical anxiety and poor mental health. Externally resourced school-based cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) interventions have been shown to be effective in treating test anxiety. Intervening in test anxiety, a sub-clinical anxiety, may prevent anxieties from developing into a clinical disorder. The primary outcomes are test anxiety, clinical anxiety, and wellbeing, measured at baseline, post-intervention, and 6 and 12-month follow-up. In addition, to identify treatment mechanisms additional measures are taken of uncertain control, metacognition, and emotional regulation., Test Anxiety|Wellbeing

0	Group Therapy Intervention for Children and Adolescents With Injection-Related Anxiety and Their Caregivers, The proposed intervention protocol is a modification of an existing empirically developed treatment (Self-Injection Anxiety Counseling) for adults with injection related anxiety who rely on self-injection for illness management (Mohr, Cox, & Boudewyn, 2003). Self-Injection Anxiety Counseling (SIAC) was developed to assist psychologists and medical staff in working with patients individually to develop strategies to reduce anxiety and increase an individual's ability to self-inject. This treatment protocol has been found to result in increased self injection in patients who experienced injection anxiety prior to undergoing this treatment (Mohr, Cox, & Merluzzi, 2005). Permission has been obtained from Dr. Mohr to modify this treatment manual to be applied to youth in group setting.||This modified group protocol consists of five group sessions. The goals of the first session include development of a group identity, psychoeducation, and physiological treatment of anxiety though the instruction and practice of relaxation techniques. The second session introduces a cognitive component to anxiety reduction and focuses on unhelpful thoughts and strategies youth and caregivers can use to counteract these thoughts. The third session implements the previously learned physiological and cognitive treatments through in vivo injection practice. A registered nurse skilled in working with youth and caregivers on self-injection will be present and active throughout this session and all infection control procedures will be followed. Problem solving strategies are implemented in the fourth session to reduce any difficulties encountered by participants as they practiced their injection goal throughout the week. The fifth session will occur two weeks after the fourth session. This extra week between sessions allows for additional practice and problem solving related to injection goals. The last session reviews problem solving strategies and celebrates the success of participants.||Relevant outcomes for hypotheses testing will be measured before treatment, after completion of treatment, and at follow-up; one measure of injection-related anxiety will be utilized more frequently throughout the treatment., anxiety|injection|needle|pediatric|youth|children|adolescents|cognitive behavioral|behavioral|exposure|group|treatment|chronic illness|adherence

Specifically, the effects of armodafinil treatment on the negative symptoms of schizophrenia were the primary assessment in this study., 0
1	Fluoxetine Essay in Children With Autism, Autism is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social interaction and communication, and by a markedly restricted repertoire of activities and interests. The population prevalence of autism is approximately 1 in 1000 (GILLBERG and WING, 1999) and the ratio of affected males to females is 4:1 (FOMBONNE, 1999). Although typically considered a childhood disorder, most persons with autism experience marked functional impairment throughout their lives. Follow-up studies of children with autism show that only 5%-10% become independent as adults, 25% progress but still require supervision, and the remaining continue to be severely impaired and in need of institutionalized care (WING, 1989). Thus, the syndrome represents a substantial public health problem with tragic cost to the individual, the family, and the community.||It is a randomized, double blind flexible dose study with parallel groups, controlled, fluoxetine versus placebo.||The final efficacy evaluation will be done after 6 months of treatment; Nine obligatory visits are planned Patients will be assessed at the following visits: base-line inclusion (D-15), and 2, 4, ,12, ,20, 22, 24 25, 26 weeks. At the 24 W visit, the final efficacy will be performed and medication will be tapered over a maximum period of 2 weeks. The final safety assessment will be performed at 26W.||BRAIN IMAGING PROTOCOL :||We will assess the resting state regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in autistic children using labeled water and PET, as it is still the most reliable and least invasive method. In addition, an anatomical and functional MRI will be performed in all children, the same day. Brain imaging studies will be performed at the Service HOSPITALIER Frederic JOLIOT (ORSAY, France) under Dr Monica ZILBOVICIUS responsibility.||Each brain imaging examination will be performed twice: 1) at time zero (T0) - before the beginning of the treatment and 2) six month later, after placebo or sertraline treatment.||Functional imaging in the resting state - Positron emission tomography :||Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) will be measured on a Siemens ECAT HR+ camera. Attenuation-corrected data are reconstructed into 63 slices, with a resulting resolution of 4.5 mm full-width-at-half-maximum. Fifteen seconds before each scan, 7 mCi of H215O is administrated by bolus injection. Data are collected during 80 s. All rCBF examinations will be performed at rest during sleep induced by premedication (4 mg/kg of pentobarbital). We have previously reported that this premedication has no effects on absolute rCBF values and regional distribution.||Anatomical MRI:||A high resolution MRI of the brain will be obtained in all children witg a 1.5 Tesla Signa General Electric scanner using a 3D T1-weighted FSPGR sequence (TR/TE/TI/NEX: 10.5/2.2/600/1, flip angle 10°, matrix size 256 x 192, yielding 124 axial slices and a thickness of 1.2 mm, field of view 22 cm). The acquisition duration is 6 minutes. In addition, FLAIR and T2 axial and coronal sequences will be also acquired.||Biological measures:||Blood sample procedure for whole blood serotonin: patients must follow a diet poor in tryptophan during two days before the blood sampling. Blood sample will be performed without premedication between nine and 11 AM. Blood will be withdrawn into tubes containing EDTA acid and aprotinin. Platelet- poor plasma (containing up to 0.1% of the original platelet count as assessed by contrast phase microscopy) is obtained within 2 hours by centrifugation (2000g, 4C, 15 mn) and frozen as 0.5mL aliquots at -80C until assess (blind procedures will be used).

In addition, the relationship between the change of depressive symptoms and adherence will be studied. Even though this study has a limitation of being designed as an open-labelled clinical study, it would be useful for clinicians because this study examines the influences toward adherence related to various factors and the changes of depressive symptoms related to switching to Paliperidone ER, which is well-proven medication., Schizophrenia, depressive symptom, paliperidone

2	Social Cognition and Interaction Training for Improving Social Functioning in People With Schizophrenia, Schizophrenia is a serious mental condition that affects approximately 1.1% of adults in the United States. People with schizophrenia experience reality perception impairments, which most commonly manifest as hallucinations, extreme paranoia, social withdrawal, and disordered thinking. Deficits in social functioning are a core feature of schizophrenia. In an effort to improve social functioning, there has been growing interest in identifying factors that underlie psychosocial impairments. One such identified factor has been neurocognition, but treatments that target solely cognitive processes do not always help overall social functioning. Social cognition and interaction training (SCIT), a group-based treatment that aims to improve both processing social information and functioning, may be an effective treatment for enhancing the social skills of people with schizophrenia. This study will compare the effectiveness of SCIT versus treatment as usual (TAU) in helping people with schizophrenia improve their social cognition and social functioning.||Participation in this single-blind study will last 11 months. All potential participants will undergo initial screening, involving the completion of a few brief tasks testing social functioning. Eligible participants will then be randomly assigned to receive SCIT plus TAU or TAU alone. Participants assigned to receive SCIT will attend twenty 1-hour weekly group sessions over 5 months. During these sessions, participants will learn ways to manage emotions, work through problems, and integrate into social situations. Participants assigned to TAU alone will meet with their case managers and healthcare provider on an as-needed basis. All participants will undergo assessments of social cognition, social functioning, and psychotic symptoms prior to treatment, immediately post-treatment, and 6 months after treatment. Each assessment will last 3 hours and will include interviews, questionnaires, and a variety of tasks testing social skills. Researchers will also contact a family member or significant other about the participant's social functioning at the same three assessment times noted above., Social Cognition|Group Therapy|Psychosocial Intervention
2	An Efficacy and Safety Study of Paliperidone Extended-Release (ER) Tablets in Participants With Schizophrenia, This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single-arm (getting one dose of medicine), multi-center (conducted in more than 1 center) study to evaluate tolerability, safety and efficacy of flexible daily doses of paliperidone ER in participants with acute schizophrenia. All participants will be given paliperidone ER once daily at a dose of 3, 6, 9, or 12 milligram (mg) tablets orally depending on Investigator's discretion, based on participant's clinical response and tolerability towards paliperidone ER. The duration of the core phase of the treatment will be 6 weeks and the participants who will complete this phase, respond well and would like to continue, will be eligible to be enrolled in an extension phase, which is no longer than 12 months. Efficacy will primarily be evaluated by treatment response evaluated through total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) score. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study., Schizophrenia|Paliperidone Extended Release (ER)|Invega
2	A Study to Evaluate Symptomatic Remission in Schizophrenia With Long Acting Risperidone Microspheres, Although most of Korean schizophrenic patients currently take oral antipsychotic medications, it is estimated that up to 75% of them have difficulty adhering to daily oral regimen. Long-acting injectable formulation may eliminate this need for daily medication. This is a prospective, open-label, multicenter study to determine the long-term efficacy, especially symptomatic remission rate of long-acting risperidone microspheres administrered in the muscle at 2 week intervals in patients with schizophrenia.||The patients will receive intramuscular injections either 25, 37.5, 50 mg equivalent of risperidone at every 2 weeks for 1 year, Schizophrenia|risperidone|Intramuscular injection, long-acting risperidone
2	A Safety and Pharmacokinetic Study of Paliperidone Palmitate in Patients With Schizophrenia, This is an open-label (identity and dose of study drug will be known to patients), safety and pharmacokinetic study of the highest dose (150 mg equivalent) of paliperidone palmitate (referred to as study drug) administered by intramuscular (IM) injection (injection into the muscle) in patients with schizophrenia. A total of at least 200 adult patients with schizophrenia will participate in the study. The study will consist of 2 phases: an up-to-21-day screening period and a 53-week open-label treatment period including an end of study/withdrawal visit. The total duration of the study will be approximately 56 weeks. At the screening visit, if a patient has been treated with an antipsychotic medication before study entry, the medication may be continued during the study except for protocol-specified medications that are not permitted. If patients have not received previous treatment with at least 2 oral (by mouth) doses of the antipsychotic agents risperidone or paliperidone or 1 dose of injectable RISPERDAL CONSTA or paliperidone palmitate, they will undergo a 4-day evaluation period and receive a 6 mg/day oral dose of an extended-release (ER) formulation of paliperidone to evaluate their ability to tolerate study drug. Patients who are able to tolerate study drug and meet all other entry criteria for the study will then be administered a single IM injection into the deltoid muscle (upper arm) of paliperidone palmitate 150 mg equivalent (eq) on Day 1 (Treatment A). Patients who tolerate Treatment A will receive a 2nd IM injection in the deltoid muscle of 150 mg eq on Day 8 followed by 150 mg eq administered by IM injection in the deltoid or gluteal (buttocks) muscle once every 4 weeks for the remainder of the 53-week treatment period. Patients who do not tolerate Treatment A or who do not wish to have multiple blood samples collected for pharmacokinetic testing will be assigned to Treatment B. Patients who do not tolerate Treatment A will receive a single IM injection of study drug 100 mg eq at their next scheduled visit followed by a flexible dose schedule of study drug ranging from 50 to 150 mg eq administered by IM injection in the deltoid or gluteal muscle every 4 weeks for the remainder of the 53-week treatment period. Blood samples for pharmacokinetics (ie, to test the concentration of study drug in the blood) will be collected at specified times before and after each dose of study drug from all patients; additional blood samples for pharmacokinetic testing will be collected from patients receiving Treatment A. An additional blood sample may also be collected at any time during screening or before the first day of IM administration of study drug for patients who agree to participate in an optional part of the study called a pharmacogenomic evaluation (genetic testing) for possible use in characterizing the safety and/or efficacy of study drug in relation to the pharmacogenic (genetic) profile of the patient. Periodically during the study, patients will be assessed for the presence of psychiatric symptoms and severity of symptoms. The safety and tolerability of paliperidone will be evaluated by monitoring adverse events (side effects) and relevant changes in laboratory values, electrocardiogram (ECG), vital signs measurements, physical examinations, and extrapyramidal symptoms (ie, symptoms that can be associated with taking antipsychotic drugs) scores reported from the time of screening to the end of the study (Day 372 or at the time of the patient's early termination from the study). The concentration of paliperidone in plasma (colorless portion of blood) from blood samples collected from Day 1 through to the end of the study will also be determined. Since only limited information exists regarding the repeated administration of doses of paliperidone palmitate, an internal review board will meet 2 times during the study to review safety data collected. The first review of safety data will be performed after approximately 30 patients complete 99 days of treatment and the second review of safety data will be made after approximately 75 patients complete 176 days of treatment. After each review of safety data, the safety review board will make a recommendation to continue the study, modify the protocol, or to terminate the study. Patients will receive 1 injection in the deltoid muscle of Treatment (Tx) A (study drug 150mg eq) on Day 1. Patients will then receive 1 injection in the deltoid muscle of Tx A on Day 8 followed by 1 injection every 4 weeks in the deltoid or gluteal muscle OR patients will be assigned to Txt B and receive 1 injection in the deltoid or gluteal muscle of study drug 100mg eq at next visit followed by 1 injection every 4 weeks of study drug 50 to 150mg eq in the deltoid or gluteal muscle., Paliperidone palmitate|paliperidone ER (INVEGA)|R092670PSY1008|Risperidone|Risperdal (RISPERDAL CONSTA)|Pharmacokinetics

2	L-arginine in Treatment as Usual in Schizophrenia, In the current study, our goals were to examine the clinical benefits of the nitric oxide (NO) donor and main precursor of NO, L-arginine, to further improve the symptoms of schizophrenia with minimum or no additional side-effects. L-Arginine is classified as a semi-essential or conditionally essential amino acid depending on the developmental stage and health status of the individual. Glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors have functional connections to the NO system in the brain. Dysfunction of connectivity of the neuroregulators glutamate and NO have been implicated in mechanisms of psychosis. Therefore, any downstream effects of NMDA dysfunction in schizophrenia may be ultimately mediated by the NO system at a cellular level. As an augmenting treatment to antipsychotic therapy, we examined the ability of L-arginine to further improve residual symptoms in the illness., 0

1	"Effects of Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy on Children With Autism, Participants & Setting||Participants in this study will be 30 consecutive children referred to Thoughtful House for the treatment of autism or a related developmental disorder. Participants may or may not also be concurrently receiving intensive behavioral intervention services from the Center for Autism and Related Disorders. All therapy and behavioral testing sessions will occur on the premises of Thoughtful House.||Inclusion Criteria||The following criteria will be considered inclusionary:||Male and female children 2-10 years diagnosed with autism, PDD, or Aspergers||No anticipated changes in treatment for the study duration (e.g., diet, nutrients)||No additional biomedical treatments started 6 weeks prior to enrollment|No changes in dietary management for 3 months prior to enrollment|Access to Thoughtful House on a daily basis, or as necessary for the study participation||In addition, the child participant must be:||Ambulatory or require minimum support walking, per parent|Able to sit still for 5 minutes or longer with a preferred toy item, per parent|Adequate vision and hearing for the purposes of test administration, per parent|Adequate arm-hand-finger coordination (i.e., able to point) for learning and cognitive tasks used in outcome measurement, per parent|Stable and controlled medical disorder|Under the care of a caregiver willing to participate by attending regularly scheduled appointments and completing the necessary measures||Exclusion criteria||The following criteria will be considered exclusionary:||Current otitis media Sinus infection Asthma Pulmonary cysts Emphysema Upper respiratory infection Severe claustrophobia, intolerance to being in the chamber History of Seizures Unstable/uncontrolled disorder of any kind||Design Ten sets of multiple baseline measurement groups, 3 participants each (n=30) will be used to evaluate the effects of HBOT on the behavioral measures of adaptive (mean length of utterance, MLU), aberrant, and stereotyped behaviors. The first participant in each multiple baseline will receive sessions of the behavioral measures for a minimum of one week prior to the implementation of HBOT. Subsequent participants cannot receive HBOT until an effect is observed (as determined via visual inspection and statistical analysis of the data) on prior participants or until prior participants have received 40 HBOT treatments, whatever occurs first. Subsequent to receiving 40 HBOT treatments, each participant will be given a break from HBOT for at least one week, during which time the schedule of behavioral measures will remain the same. If proficiency on the behavioral measures decreases when HBOT is terminated for one week, HBOT may be reinitiated as per the discretion of the physician and parent.||HBOT Systematic Desensitization||Because children with autism often do not tolerate changes in the environment, we anticipate difficulties with initial treatment compliance in some children. In a clinical setting, children become acquainted with the mask and machine, and are introduced to an enclosed oxygen chamber and HBOT begins at a prescribed pressure. Below are the general desensitization procedures for the participants:||The child is introduced to the mask and therapist models how it is worn|The child is required to hold the un-strapped mask loosely against his/her face until he/she can breathe while holding the mask in place for a minute or more|The child is required to strap the mask on for a minute, with gradual increase to 30+ minutes|The child is seated upright in the chamber with the mask on and the HBOT machine off for a minute, with a gradual increase to 30+ minutes|The child is lying down in the chamber with the mask on and the HBOT machine on at a low pressure setting for a minute, with gradual increase to 30+ minutes|The child has the mask strapped on and lying down, while the HBOT is running for an hour||For some children who exhibit severe noncompliance with the HBOT procedure, relaxation training and listening to preferred music prior to the HBOT procedure may be used.||In order to minimize the influence of learning and attention from parents/therapists during HBOT/placebo sessions, all children will be viewing a developmentally-appropriate DVD (e.g., Disney movie) during all HBOT sessions to minimize confounding effects that may occur with other activities. The viewing of DVDs will continue throughout all 80 sessions and during follow-up.||Procedures Data will be collected according to the following schedule: prior to treatment, following 5, 15, 25, and 40 HBOT treatments, as well as at post-treatment and 1 and 3-month follow-up.||Behavioral Measures Participants who are receiving intensive behavioral intervention services during the course of the study will have continuous measures of many aspects of performance recorded daily, as a part of their behavioral intervention services. Such measures will be customized to the behavioral education needs of each child, but are likely to include, at a minimum: 1) measure of adaptive behavior (e.g., language); 2) measure of aberrant behavior (e.g., tantrums, etc.); and 3) stereotyped behavior. All such continuous measures can be observed throughout the course of the participant's involvement in the study. However, the consideration of any particular continuous measure as part of the current study would require inter-observer agreement data be collected on those measures for a minimum of 25% of the observed data. That is, a second, independent observer must record data on all behavioral clinical measures which will be included in the study. Participants who are not receiving intensive behavioral intervention services will receive only the behavioral measures described below. Participants who are receiving intensive behavioral intervention services during the course of the study will receive the measures described below, as well as any of their clinical behavioral measures for which adequate inter-observer agreement data are collected.||Repeated acquisition task||A defining feature of autism is a global impairment in one's ability to learn. Repeated acquisition tasks are commonly used in drug behavioral pharmacology studies to assess the effect of a drug on the ability of an individual to learn, that is, the efficiency with which the individual's behavior is brought under new forms of stimulus control. Repeated acquisition tasks typically involve the participant learning to respond to a new sequence of positions during each session. For example, four levers or buttons are presented and the participant must press the four buttons in a particular sequence in order to earn reinforcement. However, the correct sequence is different for every session, and typically one session is conducted daily, so the sequence of responding required to earn reinforcement is different each day. The performance of the participant can be analyzed in a number of ways including the percent correct for the entire session, the total number of responses or the number of errors made until 80% correct responding is reached.||The complexity of the task can be adjusted by varying either or both of two parameters: 1) the number of response positions present (e.g., number of buttons present), and 2) the number of responses in the sequence required for reinforcement. For example, ten buttons could be present but the participant is only required to press one particular button out of the ten in order to get reinforcement, versus pressing a sequence of ten which involves each button once, versus having only two buttons present, etc. The standard degree of complexity in behavioral pharmacology research is having four response options present and requiring the participant to respond to all four in a particular order to earn reinforcement.||Delayed matching to sample||An additional cognitive process that might be of interest when evaluating HBOT is short-term memory. A common behavioral measure of short-term memory is a delayed matching-to-sample (DMTS) procedure. In such procedures, a sample stimulus is presented and then removed and a delay occurs between the removal of the sample stimulus and the presentation of two or more comparison stimuli. The participant earns reinforcement for choosing the correct comparison stimulus. The delay between the removal of the sample stimulus and the presentation of the comparison stimuli can vary from zero to any conceivable duration, but typically does not exceed 60 seconds.||The relation between the sample stimulus and the correct comparison stimulus can be varied in order to alter the difficulty of the task. For example, the sample stimulus and the correct comparison stimulus may be identical, often referred to as ""identity matching."" This is the easiest form of DMTS. Alternatively, the sample stimulus may be related to the correct comparison stimulus in an abstract dimension. For example, the sample stimulus may be the written word car and the correct comparison stimulus might be a bicycle, with a gorilla and a fork as distracters.||Sessions can be conducted with a fixed delay or the delay can be systematically increased during the session in order to identify a threshold at which the participant is no longer able to respond correctly. For example, on the first trial, the delay may be zero second and then the delay may be increased by 4 seconds on each subsequent trial, contingent on correct responsse on the previous trial. The data are then analyzed to determine the longest delay at which the participant was consistently correct at 80% accuracy. This threshold can be considered a measure of the participant's short term memory at the time of the session.||Standardized Measures||In addition to the direct measures of behavior described above, standardized intelligence and adaptive assessments will be conducted prior to the initiation of HBOT. These will include:||ADI/ADOS WPPSI-III (2-6 years) /WASI (6+ years) Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale (VABS) Subjective Questionnaires Aberrant Behavior Checklist Clinical Global Impression ATEC Selected sections of the APEQ BRIEF Parenting Stress Index Repetitive Behavior Scale A side effect questionnaire Thoughtful House Caregiver diary||Laboratory & Physiological Measures Full physical exam (weight, height, vital signs-temperature) Otoscopic examination prior to enrollment in the study||STATISTICAL DESIGN/ANALYSIS||The primary measures will consist of changes in the rate and percentage of change from pre and post HBOT adaptive, aberrant, and stereotyped behaviors.||ADVERSE EFFECTS AND MANAGEMENT: the only 2 most commonly encountered adverse reactions are ear pain and sinus pressure.||Ear Pain: This can be minimized or ameliorated by working on pressure equalization techniques across the tympanic membrane. These techniques include:||Yawning Drinking water/juice Val Salva (Plugging nose and mouth, blowing air out the ears) Jaw thrust and swallowing Bending head to the side and yawning/swallowing. The technician can slow the rate of pressurization allowing adequate time for pressure equalization to occur||Sinus pressure: this can be ameliorated with slowing down the rate of pressurization and depressurization. Also, the administration of 0.5% Neosynephrine intranasally and pseudoephedrine can be used.||Should a serious adverse event occur, the form SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING FORM will be filled out and reported to the IRB office within 5 business days and a written summary of the circumstances surrounding the adverse reaction be submitted to the IRB for review at the next scheduled IRB meeting.||Minor reactions, such as ear pain or sinus pressure will be managed and documented by the physician., Autism|Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy|Behavioral assessments"

1	A Study of Oxytocin in Children and Adolescents With Autistic Disorder, The proposed pilot study is an essential first step toward rigorously evaluating oxytocin treatment of individuals with autism. The biologic actions of oxytocin on social cognition and prosocial behaviors and the clinical, genetic and epigenetic evidence for involvement of the oxytocin system in the pathophysiology of some cases of autism strongly suggest that supplemental oxytocin therapy could significantly improve the social disabilities involved in autism. Many people feel that these social difficulties are the most characteristic and central feature of autism. Overall, this study aims to determine the tolerability, accessibility, and feasibility of an oxytocin pilot study.||This study will consent up to 30 subjects in order to randomize up to 25 subjects into a 2-month (8 weeks) randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled initial treatment period, a subsequent 2-month (8 weeks) period in which all participants receive oxytocin, and up to three post-treatment visits that occur at week 28 (±2 weeks),an interim visit anytime between week 16 and week 76 only for those patients who plan to start oxytocin on their own outside of study treatment and who will experience a lag time between week 16 (end of open label treatment) and when outside oxytocin treatment will begin, and some time before week 76. The investigators hope that this study will help to inform future study designs in determining whether a short term or long term treatment trial is necessary to observe significant effects. This will also help to develop systematic preliminary safety measures., 0

0	The Effects of Music & Auditory Beat Stimulation on Anxiety, In this study, the investigators examined and compared the effectiveness of ABS in the theta range, calm music playlist curated by an affective music recommendation system, and the combination of ABS and the same music to reduce anxiety and stress levels (as measured by the State Trait Inventory for Cognitive and Somatic Anxiety (STICSA)) compared to a control condition (pink noise). Prior work has demonstrated that ABS and music both reduce anxiety when presented on their own. It is hypothesized that music with ABS will lead to significantly lower anxiety levels and increased calmness compared to the other experimental conditions. Approximately 163 participants were recruited from the Prolific online participant pool (https://www.prolific.co). The experiment was conducted on the Qualtrics survey platform, and the experimental treatment was provided with the LUCID Research App. After reading and agreeing with the consent form, participants provided their Prolific ID and then filled out the Short Test of Music Preferences (STOMP), Queen's Music Questionnaire, Anxiety coping method's questionnaire, Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS), Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM), Eysenck Personality Questionnaire, and the State Trait Inventory of Cognitive and Somatic Anxiety (STICSA). Participants were also asked to list any medications currently being taken (including cannabis). Participants were then randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups: (1) music; (2) music and auditory beat stimulation (ABS); (3) auditory beat stimulation (ABS) alone; or (4) pink noise for 24 minutes. Participants then received instructions on how to download the LUCID Research app on their iOS device or access the LUCID Research App through a virtual machine using their computer. Participants listened to their randomly assigned treatment for 24 minutes. Participants then completed their post-intervention questionnaires which included: the STICSA state version, SAM and PANAS. The investigators' hypotheses were that the combined, music alone and ABS alone conditions would experience a greater reduction in somatic and cognitive state anxiety compared to the pink noise control condition. These hypotheses were pre-registered using the Open Science Framework (Registration DOI: https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/VHCA5) and were based upon previous studies showing that ABS and music listening are capable of reducing anxiety. The investigators had no specific predictions for moderate and high trait anxiety participants, but their pre-registration noted their intention to recruit from both of these populations., Anxiety|Auditory Beat Stimulation|Binaural Beats|Mental Health|Music|Neuroscience|Psychology

2	Effect of Neuroplasticity Modulation in tDCS Treatment Response Among Schizophrenia Patients With Auditory Hallucination, 20-30% schizophrenia (SCZ) patients struggle with auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) minimally responsive to pharmaceutical treatments. Add-on fronto-temporoparietal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is suggested to address persistent AVH in SCZ patients. High heterogeneity among existing randomized control trials for AVH treatment in SCZ and lack of empirical studies investigating tDCS action mechanism warrants a systematic investigation into the mechanistic basis of tDCS action.||This study proposes and examines the brain's neuroplasticity potential as biological phenomena driving treatment effects of tDCS. Using a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled parallel-arm, pre-post design, changes in neuroplasticity potential with tDCS treatment for AVH in SCZ will be assessed. The four composite primary outcome measures of this study are:||changes in N100-derived event-related-potential waveforms (neurophysiological),|changes glutamine-glutamate levels (neurochemical),|changes in resting-state functional connectivity (neuroimaging), and|reduction in AVH severity (clinical).||Secondary objectives of this study are:||exploring the correlation between neurobiological measures of neuroplasticity changes induced by tDCS and clinical improvement in AVH to indicate the nature and strength of the relationship between the two;|exploring the effect of verum (active) tDCS on early course versus late course SCZ patients will uncover if illness chronicity is a potential barrier to tDCS responsivity; and|utilizing disorder-related (age at illness onset, medication, the severity of the symptom, etc.) and biographic (age, sex, years of education, etc.) features of the study sample towards predicting neuroplasticity modulation in the study sample., Auditory verbal hallucination|Transcranial Direct Current stimulation (tDCS)|Schizophrenia|Neuroplasticity
2	A Study to Compare the Effectiveness and Safety of Flexibly Varied Doses of Paliperidone Palmitate and Risperidone in Treating Patients With Schizophrenia, Paliperidone palmitate is being developed as a long-acting intramuscular injectable formulation for the treatment of schizophrenia. Many patients with schizophrenia achieve symptom stability with the available oral antipsychotic medications; however, it is estimated that up to 75% have difficulty adhering to a daily oral treatment regimen. Long-acting injectable formulations may make compliance with the treatment regimen easier by eliminating the need for daily medication. An injectable formulation of risperidone is widely used in the treatment of schizophrenia and has been well tolerated by patients with chronic schizophrenia at the recommended dosage of 25 to 50 milligrams every 2 weeks. The present study is designed to evaluate the comparability of paliperidone palmitate and long-acting injectable risperidone over 1 year of treatment.||This is a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter comparative study in patients with schizophrenia. The study comprises a screening period of up to 1 week (including periods for washout of psychotropic medications and, if necessary, an oral tolerability test) and a 53-week double-blind treatment period. In the double-blind treatment period, patients will be randomly assigned in equal numbers to receive treatment with either (1) flexibly dosed paliperidone palmitate administered every 4 weeks or (2) flexibly dosed long-acting risperidone administered every 2 weeks. Drug effectiveness and safety will be evaluated periodically throughout the study. Samples for pharmacokinetic evaluation will be collected at designated time points, and a blood sample will be collected at baseline (before the start of the double-blind treatment period) or at any subsequent visit for an optional pharmacogenomic (genetic) analysis. The study hypothesis is that paliperidone palmitate will be as effective as long-acting risperidone in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia. Paliperidone palmitate (25, 50, 75, or 100 milligrams (mg) equivalent) every 4 weeks, or long-acting risperidone 25, 37.5, or 50 mg every 2 weeks of double-blind treatment period, injected into the gluteal muscle (buttocks).

The study will consist of 6 phases: 14 days of screening phase, 8 weeks of open-label run-in phase (participants will be flexibly dosed with paliperidone ER once daily in a dose range of 3 mg to 12 mg), 6 weeks of stabilization phase (participants will continue to receive the fixed dose of paliperidone ER), double-blind (DB) phase of various length (participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either paliperidone ER or placebo and this phase will be completed after 86 relapse events are observed or if the study is positive at the interim analysis), 6 months of open-label extension (participants who experience a relapse event or who remain relapse free for the entire duration of the double-blind phase and participants who are enrolled at the time the study is terminated, will be eligible for this phase. All participants will be treated with paliperidone ER and safety and tolerability information will be collected during this phase) phase and 6 months of follow-up phase (participants who withdraw during the DB phase for any reason other than relapse will be followed for 6 months or until they experience a relapse).

A new formulation of paliperidone palmitate with a 3-month injection interval (PP3M) is being tested for use as maintenance treatment for subjects with schizophrenia who have been first stabilized on paliperidone palmitate with a 1-month injection interval (PP1M). The study consists of 3 phases: a screening/washout/tolerability phase (up to 21 days); a 17-week open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention) stabilization phase (referred to as the Open-label Phase) and a 48-week fixed dose, randomized, double-blind controlled phase (referred to as the Double-blind Phase). After completion of the Screening Phase, all patients will receive PP1M in the Open-label Phase. During this time, flexible dosing will occur at Weeks 5 and 9. At Week 13 patients are to receive the dose of PP1M that was administered at Week 9. Patients who are clinically stable at the end of the Open-label Phase will enter the Double-blind Phase and will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive fixed doses of PP3M or PP1M., Schizophrenia|R092670|Paliperidone Palmitate|Paliperidone palmitate 1 month formulation (PP1M)|Paliperidone palmitate 3 month formulation (PP3M)
0	Effect of Music on Patients' Anxiety During Lower Limb Arthroplasty Procedures Under Spinal Anaesthesia, Music is becoming an increasingly popular adjunct to traditional medical therapies. International studies have shown the numerous benefits of music in a medical setting. Music has been used effectively to decrease patients' anxiety under neuraxial anaesthesia for caesarean section. There is currently a lack of evidence supporting the use of music to reduce patients' anxiety under neuraxial anaesthesia for lower limb arthroplasty procedures. The worldwide growth of the ageing population has led to an increased demand for arthroplasty. It is imperative that the anaesthetic technique used for this procedure is both safe and is associated with high levels of patient satisfaction. The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of music, to a control, on peri-operative anxiety in patients undergoing lower limb arthroplasty procedures under spinal anaesthesia., Music|Perioperative anxiety|Spinal anaesthesia|Lower limb arthroplasty

1	Use of Functional Behavioral Assessments to Evaluate Stereotypy and Repetitive Behaviors in a Double-blind, Placebo Controlled Trials of Various Medications Used to Treat Children With Autism., Research geared towards increasing knowledge of the variables contributing to treatment response is critical to advancing intervention studies in ASD. Literature in the growing field of clinical behavioral pharmacology suggests functional behavioral assessments (FBA), when integrated into clinical trials of medication, can be important tools in elucidating the specificity of treatment effects (Mace & Mauk, 1995, Northup & Gully, 2001). The goal of this study is to evaluate the use of clinical behavioral pharmacology methods, primarily descriptive functional behavioral assessments (FBA), in a double-masked, placebo controlled trial of medications used to treat children with autism. These medications are hypothesized to reduce the stereotyped and repetitive behaviors in ASD. This study will focus on the use of descriptive FBAs in distinguishing responders vs. non-responders on the basis of behavior function, in evaluating functional patterns for stereotypy, and in using descriptive FBAs as outcome measures in clinical trials.||This study is accordance with CAN research priorities in its focus on improving methodological approaches in clinical trials (Hollander, et al., 2004). This study is also consistent with recent NIMH recommendations for clinical research. The recommendations identify the integration of behavioral research methods with traditional methods of clinical research (i.e. group designs) as important aims for ASD treatment research (CPEA/STAART working group, 2004). As such, this study fills significant gaps in two research areas: treatments for repetitive behaviors and research methodology in treatment trials for individuals with ASD.||The bio-behavioral methods proposed for use in this evaluation have been previously used to stratify and match treatments for self-injurious behavior in adults with developmental disabilities (Mace & Mauk, 1995), identify specific treatment effects of methylphenidate in children with ADHD (Northup & Gully, 2001), and more recently in evaluating the specificity of risperidone's effects on destructive behaviors in individuals with autism (Crosland, et al, 2003).||Despite that stereotyped and repetitive behaviors are a core symptom domain of ASD, behavioral pharmacology approaches to date have only evaluated the correlated symptoms of aggression, self-injurious, and destructive behaviors in ASD. Repetitive behaviors in ASD include stereotypic movements, repetition of routine behaviors, repetitive play, perseverative speech, and over-focus on restricted interests. These repetitive movements may be associated with emotional distress, tension, or dysphoria and have significant impacts on daily life. It is believed that the methods used to elucidate and specify treatment effects in other medications and disorders will also be valuable to the understanding of SSRI effects in autism.||Both behavioral and pharmacological treatments have been used to treat repetitive and stereotyped behaviors in autism. Behavioral treatments include the use of noncontingent reinforcement (Britton, et al., 2002) and alternative response training to maintain homeostasis (Johnson, Laarhoven, & Repp, 2002). Psychopharmacological approaches include the use of SSRIs given the similarity between repetitive behaviors in autism and OCD (McDougle, 1995) and evidence for serotonin dysfunction in ASD (Hollander, 2000). To date, there are few controlled studies with any of the SSRIs in pediatric populations with ASD. Hollander & colleagues (Hollander, et al., in press) at Mt. Sinai recently completed a study suggesting the efficacy of low-dose liquid fluoxetine on reducing repetitive behaviors in a double-blind, placebo controlled crossover study of 45 children with ASD. This proposed FBA evaluation would occur within another SSRI trial at Mt. Sinai, which aims to extend previous findings in a large scale, multisite investigation of the safety and efficacy of liquid citalopram in children with ASD.||Behavioral pharmacology methods Functional behavioral assessments (FBA) are the cornerstone of clinical behavioral pharmacology approaches. The goals of FBAs are to hypothesize and experimentally test the functions of maladaptive behaviors. Within the field of behavior analysis, determining the function of the maladaptive behavior is primary to developing effective interventions.||FBAs involve both experimental and descriptive assessments of behavior functions. Experimental methods, also known as functional analyses (Iwata, et al., 1982/1994), have the advantage of using experimental manipulations and direct, continuous observations of behavior. The procedures outlined by Iwata, et al. (1982/1994) are considered the gold-standard for functional analyses. The procedure involves the use of multi-element, single-subject experimental design. During the functional analysis, consequences presented for a maladaptive behavior are varied. The experimental conditions outlined by Iwata, et al. (1982/1994) are labeled by the presumed function tested in a condition and include: escape/avoidance, attention, automatic reinforcement/self-stimulation, and control (i.e. preferred toys + social attention).||Experimental methods provide valuable and reliable data on behavior functions, but involve significant time and expense for patients and experimenters. In contrast, descriptive methods are based on parent/caregiver-report, direct behavioral observations, and provide information on both consequent and antecedent predictors of behavior. Descriptive methods are strongly correlated with experimental analyses and have advantages because of the information provided on antecedent functions and in their relative cost-effectiveness (Horner, et al., 1997). This study will pilot the use of descriptive assessment methods as an outcome measure and use experimental FBAs to corroborate the results of the descriptive analyses.||The methods and outcome of this investigation will be used to design an independent clinical trial using a multi-method approach, including descriptive and experimental FBAs as outcome measures, in medication studies of repetitive behaviors in ASD. Given this research has limited funding options outside of CAN, funding this project may be a critical, preliminary step in improving our treatment-specificity research and clinical research methods in ASD.||Specific Aims||The primary aim of this study is to determine the usability of functional behavioral assessment (FBA) procedures in predicting and measuring treatment response within a clinical trial of citalopram, an SSRI hypothesized to reduce repetitive behaviors in ASD. The specific aims of the study are as follows:||To predict treatment response through results from descriptive FBAs.|To evaluate functional patterns for stereotypy/repetitive behaviors in ASD.|To evaluate the use of descriptive FBAs as outcome measures in SSRI trials in ASD and to correlate results from descriptive FBAs with standard global rating measures such as the Child Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (CYBOCS) and the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) for repetitive behaviors and stereotypy., Autism|Functional Behavioral Assessment|Citalopram

2	"Is MS14 Helpful in Schizophrenia?, Schizophrenia is a chronic illness characterized by disturbances in cognition, affect and behavior, all of which have a bizarre aspect. It is a common disorder, with a prevalence of about 1%. It has an equal prevalence in both sexes although men manifest their symptoms earlier than women. [1, 2] Individuals with schizophrenia have a 2-3 fold increase in mortality rate compared to the general population. This rate had increased in recent decades. [3, 4] Most patients are incapable of maintaining their jobs and relationships. About half attempt suicide, and about 10% succeed. Most suicides occur early in the course of the illness. [1] Optimal management of schizophrenia requires psychological, social, and occupational therapies. [2] There are a lot of antipsychotic drugs which are necessary for treatment. Risperidone, an atypical antipsychotic, has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of schizophrenia in the adolescent population in the adolescent population. [5] Although atypical antipsychotic agents have improved outcomes in schizophrenia, their clinical potential remains limited by patients' nonadherence to medication. [6] Some of the patients with schizophrenia do not respond completely to treatment and only experience a partial improvement and remain functionally impaired. While medication has been found to be effective for the treatment of ""positive"" symptoms of the disease, treatment of the ""negative symptoms"" of schizophrenia (including lack of energy, motivation, and emotions) has historically not been very successful. [4, 5] MS14 is an Iranian herbal-marine compound that has been patented by invention and patent registration office of Islamic Republic of Iran (no: 29350) and classified as equivalent to food with no observable adverse effect level (NOAEL). [8, 9] According to analytic data this compound contains many inorganic salts or complexes and also trace elements such as bromine (Br), strontium (Sr), vanadium (V), titanium (Ti), nickel (Ni) and zinc (Zn). [10] Safety of MS14 has been confirmed by sub-acute toxicity studies in rats (clinical, histopathological, hematological and biochemical). [8] A study of MS14 in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) model has shown that oral treatment of the EAE mice with MS14 not only halts the progression of the disease but also attenuates the inflammation in CNS indicating that this herbal-marine compound has anti-inflammatory effects [11].||Overall, alleviation of clinical and neurological symptoms in EAE mice by MS14 explained the beneficial effects of traditionally used MS14 in MS patients, an effect which could also be investigated in other groups of psychological and neurological diseases. Additionally, there are anecdotal but unconfirmed reports for the effectiveness of MS14 in patients with schizophrenia. In this regard, we have decided to perform a randomized placebo-controlled study on the effect of MS14 on schizophrenia, to assess the safety and efficacy of this compound., Schizophrenia treatment MS14 randomized clinical trial"

2	A Safety, Tolerability, and Treatment Response Study of Paliperidone Palmitate Administered to Patients With Schizophrenia, This study is an 18-month, single-group, open-label (name of study drug is known to patients), multicenter study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and treatment response of paliperidone palmitate administered as once-monthly injections to patients with schizophrenia who previously received treatment with oral antipsychotic medications. A target of 587 patients (inpatients or outpatients) with schizophrenia will be enrolled in the study and will receive, without cost, injections of study drug (paliperidone palmitate) on Days 1, 8, 38, and thereafter at one-month intervals up to 18 months. Enrollment in the study will be limited to patients who are diagnosed with schizophrenia within the past 5 years. The study will consist of a screening period of up to 5 days before treatment, an 18-month treatment period, and an end-of-study or early withdrawal visit approximately 30 days after the last injection of study drug. During the screening period (after patients have provided signed informed consent to participate in the study), information will be collected regarding the patients medical and psychiatric history, demographics (age and race), current symptoms of the patients schizophrenia, and whether or not the patient would like to sign an additional informed consent form to participate in the pharmacogenomic (the study of how genes affect a person's response to drugs) component of the study that involves the collection of one 10 ml blood sample (equivalent to about 2 teaspoons of blood). During screening, entry criteria for the study will be reviewed and a physical examination performed. Patients will also be asked questions about the types of healthcare resources (institutionalizations/hospitalizations, emergency room visits, etc) they utilized during the previous 12 months however, this information is optional and its collection will depend upon the availability of the data. Patients who are currently receiving treatment with any oral antipsychotic medication must discontinue the use of the medication by Day 1 of the study. If the patient was receiving a high dose of an antipsychotic medication or was also receiving an anticholinergic medication (a drug that prevents involuntary muscle movements associated with the use of antipsychotic drugs in the treatment of schizophrenia), the investigator may decide to have the patients dose of antipsychotic (and/or anticholinergic) medication tapered (gradually reduced) to discontinuation beginning on Day 1. The patients time to taper-off the previous antipsychotic and/or anticholinergic medications will depend on the dose of the medication. Patients receiving anxiolytics (anti-anxiety drugs), mood stabilizers, anticholinergics, or antidepressants greater than 4 weeks before the screening visit will be allowed to continue taking these drugs. Upon meeting the entry criteria for the study, patients will receive a total of 19 intramuscular (IM) injections of paliperidone palmitate during the 18-month treatment period as follows: 150 mg equivalent (eq) on Day 1, 100 mg eq on Day 8, 75 mg eq on Day 38, and paliperidone palmitate injections of 50, 75, 100, or 150 mg eq once monthly on Days 68, 98, 128, 158, 188, 218, 248, 278, 308, 338, 368, 398, 428, 458, 488 and 518. Depending on the patients ability to tolerate a dose paliperidone palmitate, doses may be adjusted higher or lower every 30 days per the clinicians judgment within the dose range of 50 to 150 mg eq. If the patient reports any signs or symptoms of worsening of schizophrenia, the investigator may prescribe a rescue medication (quick-relief or fast-acting medications that usually work right away to relieve symptoms) such as lorazepam (an antianxiety drug) to control agitation, irritability, restlessness, and hostility. The investigator may also prescribe an anticholinergic medication to treat involuntary movement disorders if observed in patients. All prescription and over-the-counter medications taken by patients during the study are to be reported. At the end of the 18-month treatment period, all patients will complete an end-of-study visit (or early withdrawal visit for patients who do not complete the study) to have a physical examination performed, laboratory tests (including a urine pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential) performed, vital signs measured, and information collected regarding the occurrence of adverse events and the use of medications other than study drug from the time of the previous study visit to the end-of-study (or early withdrawal visit). The primary objective of the study is to evaluate safety, tolerability and treatment response of once-monthly injections of paliperidone palmitate measured by the use of a Positive And Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS). The safety and tolerability of once-monthly injections of paliperidone palmitate administered to patients with schizophrenia will be evaluated during the study by monitoring adverse events, findings from clinical laboratory tests (serum chemistry including lipids), vital sign measurements (blood pressure, pulse rate, and weight), physical examinations, and movement disorder evaluations using the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale [ESRS-A]). All clinically significant abnormalities in patients that persist at the end of the study will be followed by the Investigator until resolution or until a clinically stable endpoint is reached. Treatment response will be evaluated 5 times during the study (Visits 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10) by findings obtained from the PANSS (a 30-item questionnaire that is administered to the patient by a qualified person [ie, rater] to measure the presence/absence and severity of positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. In addition to the safety, tolerability, and treatment response data collected, patients who volunteer to participate in the pharmacogenomic component of the study will have one 10 ml sample of blood collected at on Days of Visit 2. If a replacement blood sample is needed for the pharmacogenomic component of the study, the patient will need to sign an additional informed consent form. Patients will receive a paliperidone palmitate intramuscular (IM) injection of 150 mg equivalent (eq) on Day 1, 100 mg eq on Day 8, and 75 mg eq on Day 38.Thereafter, patients will receive once monthly IM injections of 50, 75, 100, or 150 mg eq of paliperidone palmitate. Doses may be adjusted every 30 days per the clinician's judgment within the dose range of 50 to 150 mg eq.Patients will receive a total of 19 injections of study drug over an 18-month treatment period., Schizophrenia|R092670|Paliperidone palmitate|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition|Intramuscular injection
2	Mindfulness-based Illness Management Program for Schizophrenia, Objectives: This study is to test the effectiveness of a mindfulness-based illness management program for Chinese outpatients with schizophrenia over a 24-month follow-up. The program is an integrated, insight-inducing educational program that addresses patients' awareness and knowledge of schizophrenia and skills of illness management.||Methods: A two-phase, single-blind, multi-site randomized controlled trial will be conducted with 449 Chinese patients with schizophrenia in Hong Kong, China and Taiwan. In the first phase, 107 participants will be randomly selected from the eligible patient lists of three outpatient clinics in Hong Kong only (i.e., 38 subjects from each clinic), and after baseline measurement, be assigned to either the mindfulness-based illness management program, conventional psycho-education group, or usual psychiatric care. For the second phase, the participants will be randomly selected from the eligible patient list in three study venues or countries (i.e., 114 subjects from each study site/ country) and after baseline measurement, be assigned similar to the first phase to one of the three study groups. The patients' mental and psychosocial functioning, insights into illness, and their re-hospitalization rates will be measured at recruitment and at one week, and 6, 12 and 24 months after completing the interventions.||Hypothesis: The patients in the mindfulness-based psycho-education program will report significantly greater improvements in their symptoms and re-hospitalization rates (primary outcomes) and other secondary outcomes (e.g., insight into illness and functioning) over the 24-month follow-up, when compared with those in psycho-education group or usual care.||Conclusions: The findings will provide evidence whether the mindfulness-based psycho-education program can better improve Chinese schizophrenia sufferers' psychosocial functioning and reduce their illness relapse., mindfulness-based program|Psychoeducation|schizophrenia|Chinese|outpatients
2	Event-Related Potential (ERP) Biomarkers in Subjects With Schizophrenia and Healthy Volunteer Subjects, Among the most replicated pathophysiological findings in schizophrenia is the impairment of Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) recorded during the auditory oddball procedure. In this procedure, time-locked electroencephalogram (EEG) responses are recorded during auditory processing of frequent and rare tones differing in pitch or duration. In addition, a smaller but substantial literature has reported deficits in the auditory steady-state EEG response (ASSR) to a 40 Hz train of auditory tones in subjects with schizophrenia versus healthy control subjects.||While measurement of ERPs in the drug development setting has shown promise, the instruments, infrastructure, and standardization of these methods has lagged. New, portable, easy-to-use, Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved devices are now available for the automated collection and analysis of EEG and ERP data.||This observational, non-interventional, clinical study will recruit healthy volunteer subjects (HV) and subjects with clinically confirmed schizophrenia (SZ), and will establish the mean and variance across HV and SZ cohorts, sites and repeated tests, of EEG and ERP measures collected with a standardized EEG/ERP device. The study will also examine the relationship between specific EEG/ERP features and measures of positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms and global function in SZ subjects.||The data collected in this study is intended to replicate published observations of the magnitude of deficit in ERPs in SZ versus HV subjects, and to support the design of subsequent interventional studies that will make use of ERPs. Furthermore, these data will be submitted to support qualification of the ERP biomarkers through the FDA Drug Development Tools Biomarker Qualification Program., ERP|EEG|Event-related potential|MMN|Schizophrenia|Electroencephalogram|Mismatch Negativity|N100|P3a|P3b

2	"Cognitive Factors Mediating the Relationship Between Childhood Trauma and Auditory Hallucinations in Schizophrenia, BACKGROUND A first generation of research has demonstrated strong associations between trauma suffered in childhood (physical, psychological and sexual violence) and having schizophrenia, and more specifically to experience ""hearing voices"" (acoustic-verbal hallucinations, AVH).||A second generation of research is currently examining the cognitive and affective processes likely to play a mediating role in this association. These mediators appear to include early maladaptive personality patterns and dissociative experiences. Although these factors have most often been explored separately, recent research indicates that they could be associated, and thus contribute to AVH. More specifically, another study has shown that the association between childhood trauma and predisposition to AVH is not direct but depends on cognitive factors including the impact of violence suffered during childhood on early maladaptive schemas (for example, interpersonal functioning centred on ""subjugation"", ""abandonment"", ""vulnerability"") and dissociation. However, this study was carried out on a non-clinical sample of subjects with a predisposition to AVH OBJECTIVES Here, aim is at testing a structural model of AVH, childhood trauma, early maladaptive schemas and dissociative symptoms in large sample of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and AVH (n=350).||Secondary objectives are (i) to carry out exploratory analyzes which will allow investigators to test in the model the role of all the early patterns described by Jeffrey Young instead of targeting only the schemes that are part of the model tested in previous study as the one by Bortolon and colleagues, (ii) compare the quality of the adjustment of the confirmatory model to the quality of the adjustment of the exploratory model.||METHODS||A cross-sectional, multicenter design (3 centres) will be performed. Patients included will be diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, and experience AVH at the time of the inclusion (n= 350). All will be inpatients. The study consists of one single visit in which the subjects will receive all the self-reported questionnaires to be completed:||General information sheet (socio-demographic and clinical data)|Questionnaire on traumatic childhood experiences: Childhood trauma questionnaire|Questionnaire on early maladaptive schemas: The Young schema questionnaire short form|Questionnaire about dissociative experiences: Dissociative experiences scale|Questionnaire on hallucinations: Launay - Slade hallucination scale and Cardiff Anomalous Perceptions Scale.||All questionnaires have been validated in French. ANALYSES Structural equation model performed additional analysis using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM).||The primary endpoint corresponds to significant associations (significance threshold <0.05) between the variables as in the model described by Bortolon and colleagues. The quality of the model (both measurement and structural model) will be assessed using a fit quality measure.||The secondary endpoints are significant associations between the different variables (p <0.05) and the model quality assessed with a quality measure of the fit.||HYPOTHESES It's hypothesized that the association between childhood trauma and predisposition to AVH is not direct, but depends on the impact of violence suffered during childhood on early maladaptive schemas (for example, interpersonal functioning centred on ""subjugation"", ""abandonment"", ""vulnerability"") and dissociative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia., schizophrenia|auditory verbal hallucinations|early maladaptive schemas|dissociative symptoms|childhood traumas|mediation modeling"

The laboratory protocol (pre, post, and follow-up) is the same for each; however the screening and recruitment are not. In this section, only those procedures and methods of the lab visit that are common to both are described. Next the video game intervention procedures are described. Participant and recruitment details are in subsequent sections.||Each participant will visit the Adolescent Dynamics Lab three times (pre, post, and follow-up) with only minor differences where noted. Parents will accompany children to the lab and, following the completion of consent forms (pre only), complete a set of questionnaires via computer:||Child report:||Demographics|Spence Child Anxiety Scale (SCAS)|Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ)- emotional symptoms|Top Problems questionnaire (TP)|Coping Questionnaire|Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (SEQ-C)||Parent report:||Demographics (including what interventions for child's mental health have been tried)|SCAS (report on child)|Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire - emotional symptoms (report on child)|Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DASS21, report on self)||Questionnaires at Post are the same as Pre and Follow-up except for addition of Video game evaluation (child report).||Once questionnaires are completed, the child participant will have sensors for psychophysiological recording attached by a female experimenter. First, two sensors for recording electrodermal response (aka galvanic skin response or skin conductance) will be attached to the tips of the second and third finger of the non-dominant hand. Children's fingers will be wiped clean before applying a dab of conducting gel on the two fingers and affixing the sensors with Velcro straps firmly but not uncomfortably. Next, two sticker electrodes for measuring electrocardiogram signals (e.g., heart rate) are applied in a Lead-II configuration: one affixed just below the right collarbone and the other on the side of the torso near the lower left rib. These circular stickers (about the size of a Loonie) have a metal nub to which wires are affixed via clips. Finally, a respiration belt is wrapped around the torso below the breast or pectoral muscle outside of the clothing. The belt is elastic and registers the expansion and contraction due to respiration. All three measurement devices are attached to a Biopac TEL-100 battery pack attached to the back of the participant's chair. This device is then attached to a computer in the adjacent room via the Biopac MP-150 amplifier. Physiological signals are recorded using AcqKnowledge 4.2 software from Biopac. The child and parent will be able to observe the signals as they will be recorded via a monitor in the observation room.||Once the sensors and physiological recording has been set up, the parent will be asked to leave the room and wait in a room nearby until the child has completed the tasks. The sequence of tasks is:||Baseline Physiology (3 tasks): (a) equipment baseline: watch a neutral film to allow the measurements to settle(2 minutes), (b) paced breathing to get resting respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA; a measure of parasympathetic activity) while participants breathe in and out in synch with a bar that goes up and down at 9 cycles per minute displayed on a monitor (2 minutes), and (c) pre-task baseline for calculating reactivity to social and cognitive stress (2 minutes)|Attention bias task: dot probe task. (5 minutes)|Social Stress Task: spontaneous speech on any topic of the child's choosing (3 minutes).|Quick self-report of feelings (< 1 minute)|Recovery 1: participant sits alone in the observation room quietly to assess return to baseline levels of arousal (3 minutes).|Cognitive Stress Task: counting backwards by 7's from 2148. Incorrect answers will require the participant to start over from the beginning (2 minutes)|Recovery 2: participant sits alone in the observation room quietly to assess return to baseline levels of arousal (3 minutes).||Finally, the parent will be brought back into the room as the sensors are removed. Debriefing will occur only after the final follow-up lab visit. Anticipated time to complete lab visit is approximately one hour.||MINDLIGHT GAME PLAY Participants in the treatment condition will play 5 total hours of MindLight, one hour at each sitting, over the course of 2-3 weeks. Game play will occur either in schools or at the participant's home. For the Prevention Sample, MindLight will be played in participating middle and high schools in the Limestone District School Board. Participants in the Clinical Sample who attend these schools will also play the game at the school. However, for children recruited through the Hotel Dieu Mood and Anxiety clinic (see recruitment details) who do not attend one of the participating schools will play MindLight at home. In all cases, a research assistant will be present to set up the game and monitor any equipment difficulties.||To play the game, children will wear a lightweight MindWave headset that has a single electrode that must touch the forehead (see attached images). There is a clip that attaches comfortably to the earlobe as well. The electroencephalogram (EEG) signals in the alpha, beta, and gamma frequencies are used to extract two continuous signal streams that are measures of focused attention and arousal. These signals are used in the game to control the character's ""mind light,"" a magical hat he wears that has a light on the end of a signal antenna, by focusing a beam of light toward specific targets to solve puzzles within the game and expanding the range of light inversely proportional to the degree of arousal. Thus, children control key aspects of the game with their mind.||Control participants in the Prevention Sample will play Max and the Magic Marker, a commercially available game with similar features to MindLight but without the key mechanisms targeting anxiety reduction (attention bias modification and relaxation). The amount of game play time and location will be the same as those in the intervention group.||ONLINE COGNITIVE BEHAVIOURAL THERAPY Control participants in the Clinical Sample will receive an online version of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) based on the skills taught in Mind over Mood by D. Greenberger and C. Padesky. The program provides general information on each topic, an overview on helpful skills, and homework sheets by email that directly corresponds with how a live, 8-week group therapy session would be conducted. Participants will also receive feedback on homework on a specific day every week from a therapist at Hotel Dieu.||Description of participants CLINICAL SAMPLE Children 8-16 years old who have made an appointment at the Mood and Anxiety Clinic at Hotel Dieu specifically for problems with anxiety. Only those with autism or significant developmental delays will be excluded. The investigators will recruit 100 children, with half randomly assigned to the MindLight intervention group.||PREVENTION SAMPLE Children 10-16 years old attending participating schools in the Limestone District School Board who have been identified as having elevated anxiety symptoms via a self-report measure of anxiety. Only those with autism or significant developmental delays will be excluded. The investigators will recruit 100 children, with half randomly assigned to the MindLight intervention group.||Recruitment details CLINICAL SAMPLE Participants will be recruited following initial assessment at the Hotel Dieu Mood and Anxiety Clinic. The typical wait period between this initial diagnostic assessment and the start of either group or one-on-one therapy is 3-6 months. Our intervention will occur during this wait period. During the initial assessment at the clinic, children aged 8-16 will be invited to participate in the study. They will be provided a brief explanation of the study and will indicate to the clinician whether they give permission to be contacted by the recruitment coordinator who will provide all of the details of the study. The participant will be made aware that they are under no obligation to participate in the study by agreeing to be contacted. Those who assent to participate will be invited to the Adolescent Dynamics Lab to begin participation.||PREVENTION SAMPLE Children in grades 6-10 who attend one of the participating schools will complete one questionnaire during class time, the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale (SCAS). Children who score 1 standard deviation above the mean for (a) the total score or (b) two of the subscales (not including the obsessive-compulsive scale) will be considered at risk for developing an anxiety disorder. These children will be invited to participate in the study by visiting the Adolescent Dynamics Lab. Consent for the study will be obtained from the parent prior to the SCAS screening., Video Games|Child|Adolescent"
0	Does Treating Anxiety Symptoms With ACT Improve Vascular Inflammation and Function?, The investigators hypothesize that reducing the burden of anxiety symptoms using Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) will improve vascular function, inflammation, mSNA, and oxidant stress.||The investigation also explore other secondary endpoints related to oxidant stress and inflammation in vascular endothelial cells. If anxiety increases inflammation, then we predict that ACT will reduce circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines, and produce a phenotype of endothelial cell proteins reflecting decreased inflammation compared to pre-treatment. And if anxiety increases oxidative stress, then ACT should produce a phenotype of endothelial cell proteins reflecting decreased oxidant stress and increased nitric oxide synthase activity., 0
2	"Intramuscular Depot Formulation of Aripiprazole as Maintenance Treatment in Patients With Schizophrenia, This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study consisting of a screening phase and 4 treatment phases. Eligibility was determined during a screening phase of 2 to 42 days. Patients receiving oral treatment with an antipsychotic other than non-generic aripiprazole entered Phase 1. Patients with a lapse in aripiprazole or other antipsychotic treatment at the time of study entry (""lapse"" defined as > 3 consecutive days without medication) entered directly into Phase 2. During Phase 1 (oral conversion), patients were cross-titrated during weekly visits from other antipsychotics to oral non-generic aripiprazole monotherapy over a minimum of 4 weeks and a maximum of 6 weeks. During Phase 2 (a minimum of 4 weeks and a maximum of 12 weeks in duration), patients were assessed bi-weekly and stabilized on an oral dose of aripiprazole ranging from 10 mg to 30 mg daily. After stability criteria were met in Phase 2, patients entered the single-blind aripiprazole intramuscular (IM) depot stabilization phase, Phase 3. In Phase 3, patients were stabilized on aripiprazole IM depot for 12 consecutive weeks. Once the patient met the stability criteria, they were eligible to be randomized into the double-blind phase, Phase 4. Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio (aripiprazole IM depot vs placebo IM depot) stratified by region and last aripiprazole IM depot injection dose level in Phase 3. During Phase 4, patients were assessed for impending relapse/exacerbation of psychotic symptoms. If a patient was identified with impending relapse/exacerbation of psychotic symptoms, they were withdrawn from the trial and given the opportunity to enroll into an open-label aripiprazole IM depot trial, 31-08-248. Patients that completed Phase 4 (up to and including Week 52) had the option to enroll into an open-label aripiprazole IM depot trial, 31-08-248 (NCT00731549)., Aripiprazole|Intramuscular (IM) depot|Schizophrenia"
2	Effect of Lu AF35700 in Patients With Treatment-resistant Schizophrenia, The study consists of a Screening Period (3 weeks), a single-blind Prospective Confirmation (PC) Period (6 weeks), a Double-blind Treatment (DBT) Period (10 weeks), and a Safety Follow-up Period (6 weeks).||Patients who did not fulfil the randomization criteria for the DBT Period, were withdrawn from the study after the PC period.||Patients who fulfilled the randomization criteria for the DBT Period, continued into the DBT Period and were randomized into one of 3 treatment arms (1:1:1) with either Lu AF35700 10 mg/day, Lu AF35700 20 mg/day or to continue the treatment allocated in PC Period (olanzapine or risperidone) at the dose set at last visit of PC Period. This mean that approximately one third of the confirmed treatment-resistant patients were randomised back to the failed treatment used in the PC Period.||Data was not collected separately for the DBT Olanzapine and DBT Risperidone participants, and there was no intent to compare Lu AF35700 to each drug separately., 0

1	Early Pharmacotherapy Aimed at Neuroplasticity in Autism : Safety and Efficacy, Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder defined as qualitative impairment in social interaction and communication and restrictive stereotype patterns of behavior, interests and activities. Pharmacological agents are being increasingly used off label in very young autistic children, and there is virtually no data regarding the pharmacokinetics, safety or efficacy of these agents in young children.||The approach in this study differs from pharmacotherapy studies of autism carried out thus far in several ways:||the rationale underlying our approach is based upon an attempt to alter synaptic plasticity during postnatal development, focusing on very young children|are integrating our drug trial with a PG study evaluating whether buspirone response is related to expression of genes involved in serotoninergic neurotransmission|will assess these variables together with in vivo assessment of serotonin synthesis capacity with PET.||This is a prospective, randomized, double blind, crossover study where children will be stratified by age into two groups. Treatment will last for 12 weeks with dosing twice a day. Parent ratings, cognitive tests and blood sampling will occur throughout the study period., Autism|Neuroplasticity
0	Anxiety Level Assessment of Anesthesia Providers During COVID-19 Pandemic, The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected multiple aspects of everyday life worldwide. Pandemics unleash a societal sense of fear and anxiety. Hence, the COVID-19 pandemic have had a profound impact on mental health. This has led to substantial research on this topic; however, literature evaluating the mental health effects of the pandemic on small groups of people is scarce. Healthcare workers have undergone significant psychological pressure and stress during viral surges of this pandemic. Furthermore, the levels of anxiety vary as the number of cases varies between regions and across time.||After approval by the Institutional Review Board (Protocol # 160167), a cross-sectional study was conducted to identify anxiety levels during the COVID-19 pandemic among anesthesia providers at our institution. The participants included Faculty anesthesiologists, anesthesiology residents, Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists, and Nurse Anesthetists students. Data were collected from August 26 to September 15, 2020. A questionnaire containing the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale, followed by a set of questions with binary answers to evaluate the presence or absence of anxiety-related factors during the COVID-19 pandemic, was administered through direct approach and voluntary participation of the subjects., Anxiety|Mental health|COVID-19|Coronavirus
0	Medical Hypnosis Against Anxiety and Pain in Electro-neuro-myography, Medical hypnosis is more and more used during some medico-technical investigational procedures, such as interventional radiology, dental procedures, baby deliveries. Using the modified conscious state induced by trance or by conversational hypnosis (thanks to verbal and nonverbal language) allows a better tolerance of these procedures. Only very few situations recommend against this approach.||ENMG is a frequently performed procedure in neurology to explore neuromuscular functions. It implies electric stimulations, needle insertion and needs the patient cooperation and the patient's well-being. This is all the more necessary that this procedure may be repeated for a patient along his/her life.||Only one study evaluated the effect of hypnosis on pain and anxiety during ENMG (Slack and al., 2009). Despite a low statistical power due to a small sample, it showed a reduction of the maximal pain during the needle electromyography.||More proof is therefore needed to assess the efficacity of hypnosis against pain and anxiety during ENMG.||Several members of our nurse and medical team have an experience in hypnosis practice and this procedure is sometimes used in some patients, when specifically required, alone or with other analgesic procedures (like nitrous oxide), but not in the current standard practice. This is mainly useful in patients with anxiety.||This study's principal objective is then to evaluate the effect of an hypnosis procedure, compared to a standard clinical procedure alone, on pain consecutive to ENMG, in patients presenting with anxiety when attending an ENMG. The secondary objective is to assess the effect of hypnosis on anxiety consecutive to the ENMG.||This is a monocentric, controlled, randomized, open-labeled study, with two balanced arms. The study cannot be blind since the members of the staff will apply at the same time the hypnosis procedures and the ENMG investigations.||Patients who have to undergo an ENMG due to their standard care investigations will be consecutively included as long as they're taken care of by members of the staff with an hypnosis experience and express any anxiety.||48 patients in each group will have to be include to achieve a sufficient power.||Statistical analyses will be blindly performed by our methodology, biostatistics and data management unit. All tests will be bilateral with an alpha risk of 5%, with an intention-to-treat procedure.||Our hypothesis is a reduction of pain and anxiety in the hypnosis group compared to the standard care one.||If this is confirmed, it will be an argument to offer this procedure in a systematic way to any patient with anxiety who has to undergo an ENMG as well as developing its use in other electrophysiological investigations., hypnosis|electro-neuro-myography|anxiety|pain|analgesia

2	An Efficacy and Safety Study of Extended-Release (ER) Paliperidone in Adolescent Participants With Schizophrenia, This is a multi-center (conducted in more than 1 center), double-blind (neither physician nor participant knows the name of the assigned drug), randomized (study drug is assigned by chance), active-controlled (paliperidone ER is compared to aripiprazole), parallel-group (a medical research study comparing the response in 2 or more groups of participants receiving different treatments), flexible-dose (the physician has the freedom to give different doses to the participant depending on how they respond to treatment) study designed to determine the efficacy and safety of paliperidone ER in symptomatic adolescents (12 to 17 years of age) with schizophrenia. The total duration of the study will be approximately 29 weeks. The study consists of 3 phases: a Screening phase up to 3 weeks (with a possible overlapping washout period), a Double-blind acute phase of 8 weeks, and a Double-blind maintenance phase of 18 weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 treatment groups (paliperidone ER or aripiprazole flexible oral doses). Dosage will be adjusted at the scheduled visits. Efficacy of the participants will primarily be evaluated through Positive and Negative Syndromes Scale (PANSS). Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study., Schizophrenia|Paliperidone|Aripiprazole

The study consists of a screening phase and an open-label treatment phase. Study duration will be 10 weeks and participants can either be inpatient or outpatient. The recommended paliperidone ER starting and maintenance dose will be 6 milligram (mg) per day for most participants. Throughout the study, flexible dosing ranging from 3 to 12 mg per day may be used at the discretion of the investigator. Throughout the study, participants will be evaluated for efficacy using clinician rating (Clinical and Global Impressions-Severity [CGI-S] scale, and Personal and Social Performance Scale [PSP]) scales.

The theory is based on Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), which sees meridians of life force (chi) running through the body, and aims to optimize health through manipulating the body into maximal alignment.||We are proposing a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial to examine the efficacy of acupressure as adjuvant therapy added to antipsychotics in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia.||The goals of this study are twofold:||To assess through the highest standards of empirical research whether acupressure can benefit patients with schizophrenia.|To furnish data relevant to the possible physiological mechanisms by which acupressure may produce a therapeutic effect., Acupressure|Shiatsu|Schizophrenia
2	Galantamine for Cognitive Deficits in Schizophrenia, The proposed study will entail a comprehensive evaluation of the effects of acute doses of the nAChR allosteric modulator galantamine hydrochloride (0, 4 and 8 mg) on neurocognitive measures in schizophrenic smokers (n=20) and schizophrenic non-smokers (n=10) in a human laboratory paradigm. After training on a battery of neurocognitive assessments, all subjects will be studied during three separate test weeks where they will complete the neurocognitive batter at baseline, and then again after acute administration of the three doses of galantamine in a counterbalanced order across subjects in each experimental group. Specifically, smokers would be randomized into one of two groups: 1) those who undergo overnight smoking abstinence prior to the study cognitive sessions in order to determine galantamine's effects on abstinence-induced cognitive impairment, and 2) those who may smoke as usual prior to the study cognitive sessions. The inclusion of nonsmokers will allow for the assessment of galantamine's effects on cognitive deficits in schizophrenia independent of cigarette smoking. Finally, genetic variations in key metabolic genes involved in catecholamine metabolism (COMT and DBH) would be evaluated as determinants of galantamine-related improvements in cognitive performance in schizophrenic smokers and nonsmokers.||We predict that galantamine will dose-dependently improve selected cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia (e.g., spatial working memory, sustained attention and prepulse inhibition) which we have previously shown are selectively improved by cigarette smoking in smokers with schizophrenia [18], and that this effect would be more pronounced in nonsmokers with schizophrenia. If our results are positive, they would support the rationale for controlled clinical trials using nAChR agonists like galantamine to treat selected domains of cognitive dysfunction in this disorder.||Study Design:||The following experimental groups will be studied:||Schizophrenic Smokers under abstinence conditions (n=10)|Schizophrenic Smokers in the smoking condition. (n=10)|Schizophrenic Nonsmokers (n=10)||Three acute doses of galantamine (GAL) will be tested (0, 4 and 8 mg) in all subjects during three separate test sessions separated by at least 3 days, with study medication doses across sequential subjects given in a randomized, counterbalanced manner.||Smokers (n=20) and nonsmokers (n=10) with schizophrenia will be recruited from the outpatient division of The Connecticut Mental Health Center (CMHC) in New Haven, CT, and it's affiliated satellite centers (Hispanic Clinic, West Haven Mental Health Center, and Yale Behavioral Mental Health Center).||Screening Procedures:||All potential subjects would meet with study staff over 2-3 intake and evaluation sessions to determine study eligibility, which would typically take place within 4 weeks of study enrollment. A description of the evaluation measures is given below:||The screening evaluation will include completion of informed consent forms, a urine toxicology screen to screen for recent use of illegal substances, a urine pregnancy test for female subjects, a psychiatric evaluation using the SCID for DSM-IV disorders, PANSS, AIMS, Webster, Barnes, BDI, Tiffany Questionnaire for Smoking Urges (T-QSU), Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal Scale (M-NWS), Shipley Full Scale Intelligence Quotient (IQ), a blood draw for plasma nicotine, plasma cotinine, as well as CBC and LFT's, and a physical examination conducted by Dr. George. Subjects will be separately consented for the genetics portion of the study and blood will be taken for genotyping purposes. Finally, a pre-study neuropsychological testing session would be performed in order to orient and train participants on the laboratory procedures. Subjects who are pregnant or planning on becoming pregnant will not be eligible to participate.||We will compensate all subjects who complete the screening and evaluation process ($25.00) and the neurocognitive training session ($25.00) for a total of $50.00. In addition, subjects would be paid $25.00 for donating a blood sample for genotyping.||Blood for genotyping will be obtained for COMT and DBH polymorphisms in smokers and nonsmokers in schizophrenia participating in this study. The genotyping for these studies will be done in collaboration with the Psychiatric Genetics laboratory of Joseph F. Cubells, M.D., Ph.D. at Emory University.||Experimental Procedures: Smokers will be tested on the cognitive battery at baseline (Day 1, with periodic smoking breaks to minimize nicotine withdrawal), and then again 24 hours later after overnight smoking abstinence (Day 2). Non-smokers will be tested at baseline (Day 1) and again 24 hours later (Day 2). Study medications will be given as a single dose before the Day 2 session which will produce ascending plasma drug levels (t= ½ 5/7 h) during the two hour testing session, in a counterbalanced dosing schedule of galantamine hydrobromide (0, 4, and 8 mg) within each test group. If systolic blood pressure is below 90 mm Hg, the galantamine study medication will be held. Before and after each session (Day 1 and Day 2), clinical ratings using the PANSS, HDRS, extrapyramidal ratings, and adverse event ratings would be completed. For smokers, pre-session tobacco craving and withdrawal ratings, expired breath carbon monoxide, and plasma cotinine and nicotine levels would be obtained. Smokers randomized to the abstinence condition would receive $150.00 for successful completion of each of the subsequent three test session procedures requiring overnight abstinence ($50.00 for successful abstinence, and $100.00 for subsequent testing session completion). Smokers randomized to the non-abstinence condition would be also receiving $150.00 for successful completion of each of the three test session procedures in order to maintain consistency. Nonsmokers would receive $100.00 for completion of each of the three test sessions beyond the training session. In addition, a completion bonus of $50.00 will be paid to all subjects who complete all study procedures. Thus, smokers with schizophrenia could earn $575.00, and nonsmokers $425.00 for their completion of the entire study.

1	Treatment for Children With Autism and Anxiety, Children with ASD and anxiety in our initial studies have displayed reductions in anxiety symptoms following the delivery of the FYF intervention. Given these initial successes, there are two primary purposes of this study. First, to train outpatient clinicians to fidelity on the FYF intervention for 8-14 year old children with high-functioning ASD and clinical anxiety. Second, to develop an optimal training model for learning the FYF intervention. The primary aims of Phase 1 are to develop a training manual and deliver a workshop on the FYF model to a group of outpatient clinicians in preparation for the clinicians to deliver the FYF intervention to four groups of children with ASD and anxiety. In Phase 2, the primary aims include comparing three instruction methods of learning to clinicians at three different outpatient clinics, by assessing increases in clinicians' acquisition of the intervention techniques and estimating the degree of reduction in anxiety symptoms on the primary outcome measures for the children with ASD. Instruction methods are: a) Manual, b) Workshop, c) Workshop-Plus. We hypothesize that clinicians receiving the Workshop-Plus (workshop plus ongoing consultation) condition will achieve treatment fidelity at a faster rate than clinicians receiving the other two instruction methods, and the children with ASD in the Workshop-Plus condition will display greater reductions in anxiety symptoms compared to the children in the other two conditions., 0

2	Validation of a Clinical Screening Grid for Syndromic Schizophrenia, Methods: This study aims to validate a short clinical screening grid for syndromic forms of schizophrenia linked to a pathogenic Copy Variation Number (CNV). The investigators plan to include 150 patients with defined (DSM V) schizophrenia and aged 15 years and more. The clinical grid will be prospectively fulfilled for every patients on the basis of his/her medical history and clinical examination. Array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH-a) will be performed on jugal mucosae sample to detect precisely syndromic forms of schizophrenia linked to the presence of a pathogenic Copy Number Variation (CNV).||In subjects with no CNV that may explain the onset of schizophrenia, the investigators would like to complete the investigations with exome trio sequencing. With this type of very clinical approach, the investigators wish to determine which semiological elements should alert the psychiatrists as to the presence of a syndromic form. The objective is to propose at the end of this study a simple and reliable scale, usable in psychiatry consultation, to guide the genetic screening of forms of syndromic schizophrenia., 0
2	Trial Evaluating Three Fixed Dosages of Paliperidone Extended-Release (ER) Tablets and Olanzapine in the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia, Paliperidone is being developed as a new therapeutic agent for the treatment of schizophrenia. The ER formulation of paliperidone was developed to deliver paliperidone at a relatively constant rate over a 24-hour period to improve the tolerability profile and decrease the potential for orthostatic hypotension. This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 3 fixed dosages of paliperidone ER (6, 9, and 12 mg/day) compared with placebo in patients with schizophrenia. This trial is a multicenter, double-blind (neither the patient nor the physician will know if placebo or drug is being given and at what dose), randomized (patients will be assigned to different treatment groups based solely on chance), placebo- and active-controlled, parallel-group, dose-response study. The study includes a screening period of up to 5 days, followed by double-blind treatment phase of 6 weeks. Following the double-blind treatment phase, eligible patients (those who have completed the 6-week double-blind phase or who discontinue due to lack of efficacy after a minimum of 21 days) may enter a 52-week open-label extension phase with paliperidone ER monotherapy. Patients will be randomly assigned to 1 of 5 treatments (paliperidone ER 6, 9, or 12 mg, olanzapine 10 mg, or placebo) and will take oral dosages of assigned treatment once daily during the 6-week double-blind period. At the time patients enter the double-blind period, they must be inpatients, and must remain in the hospital for a minimum of 14 full days. While patients are hospitalized, efficacy will be assessed twice during the first week and at the end of the second week. After patients are discharged from the hospital, they will return to have efficacy and safety assessments performed on a weekly basis through the end of the 6-week double-blind period. The efficacy response will be measured by the change in the PANSS total score from start of treatment to the end of the double-blind phase. Safety will be monitored throughout the study and includes assessments of the incidence of adverse events; measurement of extrapyramidal symptoms using 3 rating scales (Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale [AIMS], Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale [BARS], Simpson-Angus Rating Scale [SAS]); measurement of vital signs (lying down and standing blood pressure, pulse, temperature); electrocardiograms; and clinical laboratory tests. Double-blind: 6-, 9-, or 12-mg fixed dose of paliperidone ER, olanzapine 10 mg or placebo taken orally once daily for 6 weeks.||Open-label extension: start on paliperidone ER 9 mg taken orally once a day; maintained on a flexible oral dosage of paliperidone ER (3, 6, 9, or 12 mg/day) for 52 weeks., Schizophrenia, paliperidone

2	"A Study on Etiological Factors of Schizophrenia, Progress Report Schizophrenia is a chronic and devastating major psychiatric disorder. It costs a lot of the individual patient, the family as well as the society. Schizophrenic patients occupy around 80% of the chronic psychiatric beds. About 60 % of the acute psychiatric beds serve the schizophrenic patients at severe aggravating state of illness. The majority of the schizophrenic patients need the support of the family for their daily life. For better service of these patients, their family as well as for reducing social stigma of schizophrenia patients, more psychopathological understanding is crucial. However, schizophrenia is a complex disorder. For the past one century, the understanding of schizophrenia improved much. In Taiwan, the psychopathological study on schizophrenia deserves basic and systematic approach for clinical and academic purpose.||Before it could be possible to understand the essence of the psychopathology of schizophrenia, the descriptive psychopathology has to be well documented. The heterogeneity at the level of clinical pathology has to be delineated as the initial step of psychopathological study of schizophrenia. This is crucial under the consideration of cross-cultural application of diagnostic criteria in the definition of schizophrenia. The psychopathology of the disease category of schizophrenia as defined by the DSM-IV system was documented mainly by the literature based on the descriptive study of the patients of the Caucasian population and the related culture. Western medicine in Taiwan is totally accepted in the academic circle. From a cross-cultural point of view, this way of academic operation has to be reflected methodologically and to be examined empirically.||Research on schizophrenia psychopathology has to be of two kinds of value. The first is to be of the frontier academic work of the World Psychiatry, and the study results can contribute to the knowledge of the World Psychiatry Literature. The second is to be of native cultural value. The results could be of value in reflecting the native cultural reality and could be of value in application of these study results to clinical service.||To be at the frontier of schizophrenia research, the neuropsychological impairments underlined the clinical manifestations of schizophrenia is one major area of study. In contrast to the traditional theory of psychological defense mechanism or the psychosocial explanation of psychopathology of schizophrenia, the neuropsychological approach could provide the way to understand the neural mechanism of schizophrenia psychopathology at the level of psychological function. In the era of neuroscience achievement, this approach is promising and crucial.||The most basic psychopathology of schizophrenia is the genetic factor of etiology. In the era of molecular medicine, the genetic epidemiological and molecular genetic study on schizophrenia psychopathology is the most frontier line of schizophrenia research.||This research team leaded by the Principal Investigator, Hai-Gwo Hwu, of this PPG began this approach in July 1993. The initial work started with the Multidimensional Psychopathological Group Research Project: Schizophrenia"" (MPGRP). This MPGRP was designed based on the theoretical evolutionary model (EM) of psychopathology invented by this Principal Investigator. This EM model included multiple psychopathological factors including genetic factors, brain insults, chronic developmental life experience, neurobiological manifestations, personality-adjustment factor, environmental stress of biological and psychological factors, familial social cultural value factor and the factor of treatment. In this EM model, the disease course was hypothesized into three phases: initial subclinical stage, clinical stage, and the outcome stage after treatment. This MPGRP was thus designed following the guidance of EM psychopathological model.||To design the psychopathological study based on this EM of psychopathology, it is necessary to invent a new methodological approach. This approach included serial multi-dimensional study design. The first step was to set-up a smooth infrastructure and to collect a cohort of clinical schizophrenia cases for follow-up study, and also to collect schizophrenia family with at least two siblings affected with schizophrenia for molecular genetic study. This first step also considered that the descriptive psychopathological study, the study on search for a biological trait marker and the search for identification of linkage of possible vulnerability genetic markers of schizophrenia as the major research tasks.||The initial project started as the MPGRP from July 1993 till June 1998, the subsequent project following the initial MPGRP, was the Multidimensional Psychopathological Study on Schizophrenia (MPSS) started in July 1998 till June 2001. The focus of the MPGRP was to study the clinical manifestations of schizophrenia and the family situation in a cohort of schizophrenia patients. The MPGRP also focused on the phenotype definition of schizophrenia using CPT manifestation in the schizophrenia family. CPT was done in all of the family of schizophrenic patients. The family with at least two siblings affected with schizophrenia were collected for molecular genetic study.||In the MPSS project, the focus was on the follow-up neuropsychological evaluation of the schizophrenia cohort collected in the MPGRP, other than the descriptive follow-up clinical data collection. Besides, the MPSS also focus on the CPT and WCST studies on the family members o the family with at last two siblings affected with schizophrenia. These families are also the sample for molecular genetic study. The collection of the schizophrenia family of this kind for molecular genetic study is still the work of this MPSS, as the collection of this kind of family was not an easy task.||There are several important features characterize the uniqueness of this MPGRP and MPSS : (1) a prospective follow-up design, (2) multidisciplinary approach, (3) multi-center, multi-hospital approach, (4) operationalized assessment of schizophrenia psychopathology using the ""Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale"" (PANSS)(4), (5) covering multi-dimensional psychopathological factors, (6) representing up-to-date psychopathological study of phenotype definition, molecular genetic study, neuropsychological study, as well as the study on the expressed emotion of the chief care giver and the family burden and need of care of the patients.||This MPGRP and the MPSS were successfully carried out from July 1993 to March 2001(up to the time of sending this SEFOS proposal as the subsequent study on the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, a further step of psychopathological study on schizophrenia) based on the following facts:||1. This MPGRP and the MPSS made the multidisciplinary team to be possible in psychopathological study in Taiwan. This is not an easy task. Other than the technological breakthrough in research administration in this manner, the successful element was that this multidisciplinary approach made a smooth working infrastructure for this psychopathological research for successive research works. Other than research work itself, the attending members of this research team obtained continuous training and exercise in psychopathological study. These achievements cannot be demonstrated in literature publication.||2. This MPGRP and the MPSS made the multi-center, multi-hospital approach came true in Taiwan in psychopathological study. This institutional infrastructure guarantee that the sampling of schizophrenic cases to be more representative of patient population for psychopathological study. Other than research administration breakthrough, this approach provided a great chance for clinical psychiatrist to participate in training and practice in psychopathological basic training. Besides, the clinical service team members, other than psychiatrist, including psychiatric nurse, psychologist, psychiatric social worker can obtain the common sense understanding of general psychopathological approach in psychiatry. This close team approach will make the service team to be more cohesive in the care of the patients. The patients attending this study would obtain more attention from the psychiatric service team leaded by the research psychiatrist, especially in the successive follow-up study. This is crucial in elevating the professional activity in a positive sense embedded in this MPGRP and MPSS research. This is also one achievement of this MPGRP and MPSS in the infrastructure of this research approach. These achievements cannot be demonstrated in literature publication, but can be demonstrated in daily research and practice activities. It can also be shown in the subsequent research activities such as this SEFOS project.||3. This MPRP and MPSS brought the Taiwan Psychiatry to the frontier line of psychopathological study and contribute new knowledge to schizophrenia literature. Besides, this MPGRP and MPSS also took care of the standpoint of the native culture background. The descriptive phenomenological approach is the essence of operationalized psychopathological study. The cross-cultural modification and justification of the Western rating schedule of the PANSS has been considered and successfully done.||4. The family of schizophrenic patent was also the major area of study based on the characteristics of the Taiwan culture. The family took the responsibility of patient care closely. The burden and the need of patient care are important topic of this study. Besides, taking the advantage of the culture background of the close family tie of the patient and the family, genetic study of schizophrenia including genetic epidemiology and molecular genetics is one major task of this MGRP and the MPSS too.||5. Major academic achievements of the track of this PPG and the MPSS psychopathological study in these past 7 to 8 years included the following:||The findings of different symptom clusters of schizophrenia:||Categorical or dimensional approach of schizophrenia psychopathology is still a current unsolved issue in schizophrenia research. The MPGRP collected 234 schizophrenia subjects in the Northern part of Taiwan and designed a cohort follow-up study in 1993. At the end of this MPGRP, ranged from1998 to 2000 for data analysis, the descriptive psychopathological PANSS data assessed on admission were analyzed using explorative factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and a basic 4- dimensional model of schizophrenia psychopathology was established. These 4 dimensions are: ""Negative and associated Negative symptoms"", ""Disorganized thought"", ""Hostility/excitement"", and ""Delusion/hallucination"". Including the general psychopathological section of the PANSS, there is an additional dimension of anxiety/depression was found in the EFA. The CFA cannot found satisfactorily model for model fitting as the general psychopathology section was included in CFA. This could be due to the high variability and low base rates of these items of the general psychopathological section of PANSS. Besides, this could also be due to the peripheral nature of these symptom items in schizophrenia psychopathology.||These findings were confirmed by another statistical graphic approach, the color graphic generalized association plots (GAP) in delineating the heterogeneity of descriptive symptom pathology of the schizophrenia. In this GAP analysis, again a 4-dimension model was also found based on the PANSS data assessed on admission. These 4 dimensions were also arranged according to the proximity matrix and were revealed as the following order: (1) ""Negative symptom"", (2) ""Disorganized thought"", (3) ""Hostility/Excitement"". (4) ""Delusion/hallucination"" dimensions. The possible dimension of ""Anxiety/depression"" was also observed near the end of the dimension of ""Negative symptom dimension"".||The validity of these symptom dimensions was assessed using the impairment of sustained attention assessed by continuous performance test (CPT). It was found that the negative symptom dimension was associated with impaired CPT. Furthermore, the severely impaired (Z>3.0) d' of CPT was found to be associated with persistent negative symptom, the deficit state of clinical psychopathology, of schizophrenia. The delusion/hallucination dimension was found to be associated with the impaired neuronal activity of hippocampal region measured by the neuroimaging technology of Magnetic Resonance Spectrometry (MRS).||The GAP analysis based on the successive PANSS data assessed on admission, 6-month, 1-year and 2-year follow-up also showed a stable 5-dimension model of psychopathology. The component symptom dimensions were the same as that of the data assesses on admission. These are dimensions of ""Negative symptom"", ""Disorganized thought"", ""Hostility/excitement"", ""Delusion/hallucination"" and ""Anxiety/depression"". This research team developed the concept of core symptom dimension by selecting the stable symptom items appeared stably over the all follow up course over 4 successive assessments across the 2-year follow-up. The validity of these core psychopathological dimensions composed of core, stable symptom cluster items is still under investigation.||The findings of different subgroups of schizophrenia patients:||Based on the cohort follow-up design, it is possible to search the possibility of the existence of different subgroups of patients be categorical approach. Matched with the effort on differentiating the symptom dimensions of psychopathology, it is also possible to define the different subgroups of patients based on the composition of symptom dimensions. This research team invented this analytical approach called as the GAP analysis for this purpose. The results were partly shown in the website: http://gap.stat.sinica.edu.tw. Based on the admission PANSS data, this GAP found 4 symptom clusters of ""Negative symptom"", ""Disorganized thought"", ""Hostility/excitement"", and ""Delusion/hallucination"", and also two subgroups of patients with (GWNEG) and without (GONEG) marked negative symptoms. These two groups of patients were found to have validity from the manifestation of clinical symptom dimensions in the follow-up course and CPT performance. Besides, these two subgroups also differed in the treatment response an prognostic outcome as shown in social functions.||The GAP analysis, based on the follow-up data of PANSS assessment, can also find consistently a 4 -dimensional model of schizophrenia psychopathology. One additional dimension of anxiety/depression was also found. The patient subgrouping consistently found three patient subgroups at 6-month, 1-year and 2-year follow-up. One is of low psychopathology group (good treatment response group), the other is of marked blunt group and the last is of persistent delusion/hallucination group. The concordance of the GWNEG and GONEG and these three groups are still under investigation.||Impaired sustained attention by continuous performance test (CPT) as the trait marker of schizophrenia.||We used a CPT machine from Sunrise Systems, version 2.20 (Pembroke, MA, USA). The procedure has been described in detail I our publications. Briefly, numbers from 0 to 9 were randomly presented for 50 milliseconds each, at a rate of one per second. Each subject undertook two CPT sessions: the undegraded 1-9 task and the degraded 1-9 task. The sensitivity index (d) of the CPT performance reflects the subject's sustained attention. Family studies have indicated that sustained attention deficits as measured by the CPT are vulnerability markers of schizophrenia. The results are: (1) a substantial proportion of non-psychotic relatives of schizophrenia probands (19-34%) have CPT deficits, which can be predicted from their probands' CPT performance; (2) subjects with schizotypal personality features also exhibit CPT deficits, which are specifically associated with negative factors of schizotypy; (3) CPT deficits are present in schizophrenic patients, are particularly associated with negative and disorganized symptoms, and those with more difficult CPT versions are not amenable to neuroleptic treatment.||The familial tendency of schizophrenia in Taiwan schizophrenia proband In this MPGRP and MPSS stdy, the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Genetic Study (DIGS) and schizotypy interview schedule (SIS) were translated and modified to be useful in Taiwan subjects. The Perceptual aberration scale (PAS) and Schizotypal personality questionnaire (SPQ) were also used in community study on schizophrenia-related personality disorders. The cross-cultural consideration was employed. In community study, the schizophrenia-related personality disorders were assessed using the PAS and SPQ initially and then by DIGS and SIS interview. Including schizophrenia-related personality disorder in the spectrum did not increase power for linkage analysis o schizophrenia. This is one important information for our molecular genetic study of this MPGRP and MPSS.||Explorative neurobiological study on the schizophrenic samples of this MPGRP and the MPSS project.||The neuropsychological study of the MPSS design and the impact of the concept of endophenotype of molecular genetic study induce this MPSS research team to explore the role of the neurophysiological parameter of P50 inhibition and the neurochemical parameter of neuronal activity shown in Magnetic Resonance Imaging Spectrometry (MRS) of relative concentrations of various specific biochemical molecules such as choline and creatinine.||The P50 study and the related neurophysiological study provided the chance to study the implicit and explicit study paradigm of schizophrenia. The implicit learning of color in schizophrenia was fond to be significantly impaired as compared to the controls. The 3-D dimension display of brain energy in this P50 study showed that the energy distribution of the schizophrenic patients was significantly different from that of the controls. The MRS study showed that the positive symptom cluster was correlated to the decreased neuronal activity of the hippocampal region. These study results make it possible for this research tem to design the research on the all family members of the schizophrenia proband for pathogenesis genetic study on multi-etiological factors and their interaction by using these neurobiological parameters designed in this SEFOS, an investigation on the dynamic pathogenetic process of schizophrenia, leaded by this Principal Investigator with smooth working infrastructure for multidimensional psychopathological study on schizophrenia.||Molecular genetic study on locating vulnerability gene in different chromosome regions.||Linkage study and association study were performed in this project for locating the vulnerability genes of schizophrenia by examining the warm spots of schizophrenia in some chromosome regions of chromosome 1q, 6p, 8p, and 15q. The study results, so far obtained in this laboratory using 52 Taiwanese families with at least 2 siblings affected with schizophrenia, could not exclude the possible existence of the schizophrenia vulnerability genes locations in these chromosome regions.||Further study of the PPG of SEFOS will focus on these positions of these 5 markers with potential linkage to find closer genetic markers possibly linked with schizophrenia using closer genetic markers such as the combination of dinucleotide and SNP markers. The candidate genes around these genetic markers will also be explored to search for mutations related to the pathological variation of schizophrenia. This will be the focus of this PPG of SEFOS too following this MPGRP and MPSS.||This laboratory is exploring for the possibility of the candidate gene approach based on plausible animal model of schizophrenia and/or pathophysiological process of schizophrenia. The NMDA subunit R1 receptor gene and nicotinic receptor alpha 7 subtype genes are two genes under exploration. The skin test of niacin test was also explored in this laboratory for the possible association with genetic defect in the phospholipid metabolism related genes. These will be included in this PPG of SEFOS study in the future.||Expressed emotion and burden of the family of schizophrenic patients The family as a unit of study is also concerned in this MPGRP and the MPSS. The expressed emotion was once considered to be a stable trait of the family chief caregiver and was hypothesized to have specific psychopathological meaning in schizophrenia. However, the expressed emotion of the Taiwanese schizophrenia family was found to be changing according the course of illness. It was not stable. The family burden was found to be very high and specific clinical measures for relieving thee family burden has to be designed for better clinical service of the schizophrenia family.|Invention of statistical method for psychopathological study The multivariate nature of the psychopathological data demands the invention of novel statistical method for data management. In this MPGRP and the MPSS, the analysis of 33 PANSS symptoms and the subgrouping of the patients in the study of schizophrenia heterogeneity invite a development of the new color graphic approach in the exploration of symptom dimensions and patent subgrouping. This was named as Generalized Association Plots (GAP). This demonstrates the fruitful approach in the multi-disciplinary team-work in the psychopathological study.|Data bank establishment of this MPGRP and the MPSS. In the past 7 to 8 years of the MPGRP and MPSS work, important data banks of clinical psychopathology of schizophrenia were established. These data banks will be useful for successive data analysis to test the various hypotheses related to the issues of heterogeneity of schizophrenia. These data banks included (1) basic clinical data bank of schizophrenia cohort of 234 cases and their follow-up clinical data for up to 7 years of follow-up data, (2) data bank of objective ratings of PANSS, ESRS, and CDRS, and (3) neuropsychological testing data bank of successive follow-up neuropsychological evaluations. The DNA bank and cell-line bank of the families of schizophrenia and other related disorders is also very important for further molecular genetic evaluation.||Other than this DNA data bank of this MPGRP and MPSS, this laboratory also performed the Taiwan Schizophrenia Linkage Study (TSLS) in collaboration with researchers of the Harvard Medical School under the support of the NIMH, U.S.A., to collect 600 families with at least two siblings affected with schizophrenia. This data bank included DIGS, DNA and CPT as well as WCST. This research team will use this data set to replicate the initial findings obtained in this laboratory originally. This will be one major focus of the subsequent SEFOS of this PPG.||All these data banks justify the abundant resource of data for continuous data analysis and paper publication of this SEFOS of the PPG, and this is the reason that this SEFOS has to set the core containing a statistical sub-core unit for the operation of data analysis. Up to the present, this research team is mature enough to do continuous data analysis and serial hypothesis testing. All these data provided the evidence that the grant of this SEFOS will, apparently, achieve the expected results of this research team with great confidence.||6. The progress of the MPSS (July, 1998 - June 2001) till March, 2001 as the PPG of SEFOS was proposed. Three sub-projects were reported to be as the following:||1) Phenomenological and neuropsychological manifestations of schizophrenia: a prospective follow-up study.||(2) A family-genetic study of co-affected sib-pairs with schizophrenia. (3) Molecular genetic study on schizophrenia using co-affected sib-pair and association strategies.||In conclusion, this MPSS has been going on smoothly in data collection as well as in data analysis. The paper publication is going on steadily. These three sub-projects were integrated and coordinated smoothly. Besides, the preliminary works using the neurobiological technology of neurophysiology and brain Magnetic Resonance Spectrometry (MRS) for measurements of psychopathological related manifestations have been performed. These technologies were proved to be satisfactorily stable and applicable in psychopathological study. The preliminary results were obtained and manuscripts were prepared for submission. Actually, the technology can also be extended to the other brain parts including the frontal region and the measurement of tractography is also available in the imaging laboratory of the National Taiwan University Hospital.||The past tract record of the achievement of the smooth working infrastructure of this research team leaded by the P.I. Hai-Gwo Hwu, including multidisciplinary specialists and multi-institutes, the achievement of the advanced technologies of neurobiological measurements related to the study of current psychopathological investigation of schizophrenia, the previous achievement in psychopathological hypothesis testing and the academic achievement of this research team, and the abundant data bank, highly justify that this research team of the SEFOS of this PPG is a well cultivated research tem in schizophrenia research. This SEFOS of PPG can positively be expected to have successful results in the future if this team has this SEFOS grant for the coming 5 years of research work., Schizophrenia"
2	Adjuvant Treatment With a Glycine Uptake Inhibitor in Participants With Negative Symptoms of Schizophrenia (P05695) (MK-8435-001), The primary features of schizophrenia are characterized by positive (irrational thoughts and/or behavior) and negative symptoms. Negative symptoms are the gross absence of normal behavior and emotions, and usually include a general lack of engagement, social withdrawal, and loss of goal-directed behavior.||Negative symptoms may strongly affect daytime activities and quality of life. The effects of currently available antipsychotics on negative symptoms are not satisfactory and leave much room for improvement. MK-8435 (Org 25935) is an investigational drug that may help to correct the above characteristics of schizophrenia by facilitating the messenger function of an amino acid in the brain, called glutamate. Preliminary data suggest that lowered glutamate levels in schizophrenia are associated with a failure to activate relevant areas in the forebrain and with prominent negative symptoms., Negative symptoms|Glycine Uptake inhibitor|Add-on treatment|Second Generation Antipsychotic
2	An Extension Study to a Clinical Study That Will Continue to Evaluate the Effectiveness and Safety of SEP-363856 in People With Schizophrenia That Switch to SEP-363856 From Their From Their Current Antipsychotic Medication, This is a 24-week, outpatient, multicenter, flexible-dose, open-label extension study designed to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of SEP-363856 (50 to 100 mg/day) for the treatment of subjects with schizophrenia who have completed Study SEP361-308 treatment period, during which they were switched from a previous antipsychotic treatment to SEP-363856., Schizophrenia

2	Quetiapine Related Neurochemical Changes as Measured by Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy in Schizophrenia, The impact of medications on MRS changes in brain of schizophrenia patients have rarely been studied through a well-controlled study. Most of the MRS studies in schizophrenia patients are cross-sectional and uncontrolled and devoid of any comparison between effects of different drugs. To date, only limited research has explored this issue and the results are conflicting. These conflicting results may be related to small sample size, different patient population and design in these studies. Thus, further studies are warranted. Besides, with the advent of new generation atypical antipsychotics, it will be important to know whether atypical antipsychotics exert different effects on neurons from conventional antipsychotics. If neuronal activity can be improved by atypical antipsychotics, the findings will have great clinical implications.||Fifteen patients in the experimental group will receive MRS examinations (including bilateral frontal and temporal area) in two phases: baseline (when they are on a conventional antipsychotic) and 4 weeks after shifting from that conventional antipsychotic to quetiapine. Another 15 schizophrenia patients receiving conventional antipsychotics will serve as the control group. The control group will receive the MRS examinations twice (baseline and 4 weeks later) without change of medications. In each phase, every patient will also receive the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) assessment. The changes of the MRS markers will be analyzed and compared, both within and between the 2 groups, and their correlations with the PANSS scores will be explored., schizophrenia|quetiapine|conventional antipsychotics|magnetic resonance spectroscopy

2	Pan European Collaboration on Antipsychotic Naïve Schizophrenia II, The study is a prospective 2 year multimodal follow-up study of initially antipsychotic-naïve first-episode psychotic patients involving a standardized intervention with monotherapy with aripiprazole during the first 6 weeks. Patients and matched healthy controls will be examined at baseline and after 6 weeks, 6 months and 2 years.||Levels of glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) are measured by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) in the anterior cingulate cortex ACC and thalamus. Presynaptic Dopamine level is measured with Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography (PET/CT)-scanning using 3,4-dihydroxy-6-[18F]fluoro-L-phenylalanine (18F-DOPA). Disturbances of the reward system is measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) . Regional cerebral blood flow and activity in the same regions are measured with Pseudo-continuous arterial spin labelling (pCASL). The default mode network, functional and structural connectivity in the associated macro circuits are measured with resting state fMRI, EEG, and diffusion tensor imaging. Structural brain changes (in grey and white matter) are measured with MRI. Cognitive functions are measured with a neuropsychological test battery, and early information processing with event related EEG and electromyography (EMG) (psychophysiological examinations).

2	Continued Early Intervention for Recent-onset Schizophrenia, Early intervention for schizophrenia has spawned considerable enthusiasm among clinicians without solid research evidence to suport its benefits and costs. The present study is a random-controlled study of integrated biomedical and psychosocial treatment on a population of recent-onset cases.||Comparison(s): 50 consecutive referrals with schizophrenic disorders of less than two years duration were allocated randomly to a comprehensive model of integrated treatment or standard care for two years. Main outcome measures was psychopathology, psychosocial functioning and hospital admissions., schizophrenia|psychosocial treatment|outcome
2	Combination of NMDA-enhancing and Anti-inflammatory Treatments for Ultra-resistant Schizophrenia, Several lines of evidence suggest that both NMDA and inflammatory hypotheses have been implicated in schizophrenia. Previous study found that some NMDA-enhancing agent was able to augment efficacy of clozapine for clinical symptoms but not cognitive function in the treatment of ultra-resistant schizophrenia. In addition, several drugs with anti-inflammatory properties have been tested in clinical trials for the treatment of schizophrenia. Whether a drug with anti-inflammatory property can strengthen the efficacy of an NMDA-enhancer (NMDAE) in the treatment of ultra-resistant schizophrenia remains unknown.||Therefore, this study aims to compare NMDAE plus a drug with anti-inflammatory property and NMDAE plus placebo in the treatment of ultra-resistant schizophrenia. The subjects are the patients with ultra-resistant schizophrenia who have responded poorly to clozapine treatment. They keep their original clozapine treatment and are randomly, double-blindly assigned into two treatment groups for 12 weeks: (1) NMDAE plus Anti-inflammatory Agent (AIFA), or (2) NMDAE plus placebo. Cognitive functions are assessed at baseline and at endpoint of treatment by a battery of tests. Clinical performances and side effects are measured at weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12. The efficacies of NMDAE plus AIFA and NMDAE plus placebo will be compared.||Chi-square (or Fisher's exact test) will be used to compare differences of categorical variables and t-test (or Mann-Whitney test if the distribution is not normal) for continuous variables between treatment groups. Mean changes from baseline in repeated-measure assessments will be assessed using the generalized estimating equation (GEE) for both primary and secondary outcomes . All p values for clinical measures will be based on two-tailed tests with a significance level of 0.05., Ultra-resistant schizophrenia|NMDA|Inflammation

1	Effects of Hyperbaric Oxygenation Therapy on Adaptive, Aberrant and Stereotyped Behaviors in Children With Autism, Positive treatment effects of HBOT have been reported in a number of studies, while others have found no demonstrable effect. Studies to date have evaluated effects on a variety of conditions, and utilized diverse research methods and generally await replication. Despite its increasing usage in children with autism, and the preliminary anecdotal reports indicating positive outcome, there is a paucity of well-controlled studies of HBOT in this population, which precludes clinicians from recommending and/or implementing it as an evidence-based treatment. It is clearly important therefore, to evaluate carefully the treatment effects of HBOT using robust research designs in this population.||Hypotheses||Hyperbaric Oxygenation Therapy will be associated with a positive effect on symptoms of autism.|Treatment gains obtained from Hyperbaric Oxygenation Therapy will be maintained at follow-up.||Specific Aims||Evaluate the effects of Hyperbaric Oxygenation Therapy on behavioral and cognitive symptoms of autism before, during, and after treatment.|Determine the percentage of children with autism who respond positively to 80 HBOT treatment cycles and the extent to which they do so.|Determine the extent to which any observed treatment effects are maintained up to three months after HBOT.||Study duration: Two weeks baseline, 10-15 week acute phase, with 1- and 3-month follow-ups.||All participants will spend one hour per session in hyperbaric oxygen chambers, for a minimum of 6 and a maximum of 10 sessions per week.

2	Paliperidone Palmitate Flexible Dosing in Schizophrenia, This study explores the tolerability, safety and treatment response of flexibly dosed paliperidone palmitate in approximately 1,000 patients with schizophrenia previously unsuccessfully treated with an oral or LAI antipsychotic medication. Non-acute and acute patients will be involved in the study. This study consists of a screening phase, a 6-month core treatment phase, and an optional extension phase. A transition period of preferably a maximum of 4 weeks will be allowed for the previous oral antipsychotic. When switching patients from previous LAI antipsychotics, paliperidone palmitate will be initiated in place of the next scheduled injection. Patients without source documentation of previous risperidone or paliperidone exposure must undergo oral tolerability testing with paliperidone ER (3 mg/day) for the 2 days prior to Baseline Visit. Patients who successfully complete the 6-month core treatment phase and would like to continue treatment with paliperidone palmitate may be enrolled in an optional extension phase until paliperidone palmitate is available in their respective country or until a maximum duration of 12 months after the last subject has completed the 6-month core treatment phase, whichever comes first. Patients will receive, without cost, paliperidone palmitate. Patients entering this optional extension phase, will receive once monthly injections with paliperidone palmitate. The recommended maintenance dose for these monthly injections is 75 mg eq. once monthly but flexible dosing in the range of 50 to 150 mg eq. once monthly will be allowed. The doctor may flexibly increase or decrease the dose preferably by one dosing level (within the range of 50 to 150 mg eq.) according to patients' clinical needs. During the extension phase, two types of visits can be distinguished: 'assessment visits' and 'treatment-only visits'. At each assessment visit (once every 3 months +/- 7 days), patients will receive their injection and will be questioned about adverse events (AEs). Body weight will also be assessed. Paliperidone palmitate will be given once monthly by injection in either the upper arm or buttocks muscle, but start every time with upper arm application. The recommended maintenance dose for these monthly injections is 75 mg eq., range could be between 50 to 150 mg eq., Paliperidone palmitate|Schizophrenia|Intramuscular injection
0	Clinical and Cost Effectiveness of Alpha-Stim AID CES, Participants will have a baseline visit (day 1, visit 1) following identification as potentially eligible. The baseline visit will be face-to-face with a member of the research team, held at routine facilities used by the IAPT service. At the baseline visit, the participant will be consented for participation, have a urine pregnancy test first (if a female of child bearing potential) and the research team will administer the GAD-7 secondly, followed by EQ-5D-5L, WASA, PHQ-9, Athens, and CSRI surveys. Participants will then be instructed on how to use the Alpha-Stim AID device, and will have their first 60 minute, self-directed treatment session at home.||All further visits will be facilitated via telephone, scheduled between the research team and participant, within a 5 calendar day window of each time point.||At visit 2 (week 4), visit 3 (week 6), visit 4 (week 8), visit 5 (week 12) and visit 6 (week 24), the research team will administer the GAD-7, EQ-5D-5L, WASA, PHQ-9 and Athens. The CSRI will be repeated only at visit 5 and 6. Compliance with the 60 minute daily treatment session will also be assessed during the 6 or 12 week treatment window, in addition to any adverse events.||The 60-minute self-directed Alpha-Stim AID treatment sessions are undertaken at participant's home, on a daily basis for 6 weeks for all participants. During this 6-week period, participants will be on the waiting list for high intensity psychological therapy interventions.||Following 6 weeks of Alpha-Stim AID CES treatment, participants have the option to receive a further 6 weeks of treatment, which is likely to coincide with start of high intensity psychological therapy interventions as clinically indicated.||Following a maximum of 12 weeks' treatment with Alpha-Stim AID CES, all participants will cease to receive treatment on study.||All participants will continue to receive standard care assessment, as undertaken by the NHS IAPT service, standard care high intensity psychological therapy interventions as clinically indicated and provided by the NHS IAPT service, and standard care pharmacological treatments as prescribed by the participant's GP. Participation in this study will not influence nor compromise standard care treatment - all study procedures are additional to standard care. Participation in the study will have no impact upon the duration of the waiting time for high intensity psychological therapy interventions., 0
2	Neurobiological and Neurocognitive Disturbances in First-episode Schizophrenia, Patients and matched healthy controls are examined at baseline and again after the patients have been treated for 6 months with a combined 5-HT2A- and dopamine D2- receptor blocker. We have chosen the atypical antipsychotic compound, quetiapine, for the present study since this drug is characterized by a fast koff/low affinity for the dopamine D2 receptors. The purpose of the study is to examine pathophysiological and neuropsychological mechanisms - not treatment effects. We want to characterize neurobiological and functional endophenotypes or vulnerability indicators and to study their stability over time and their relation to treatment and contemporary psychopathology. To the extent that candidate endophenotypes can be characterized as stable and independent of treatment and contemporary psychopathology they will be analysed together with similar findings from previous (identical)cohorts of schizophrenic patients. Specific disturbances will also be related to candidate genes for schizophrenia., first-episode|altanserin|5-HT2A receptors|MRI|fMRI|PPI|P300|P50 gating|endophenotypes|vulnerability indicators|quetiapine
2	A Study of Long-acting Injectable Risperidone in the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder, Although many schizophrenia patients currently take oral antipsychotic medications, it is estimated that up to 75% of them have difficulty adhering to the daily oral regimen. Long-acting injectable formulations may eliminate the need for daily medication and enhance patient compliance with the treatment regimen. This safety study is an extension of a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, parallel group study that investigates effectiveness and safety of risperidone injected intramuscularly in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. The present open-label study evaluates 3 different doses of a formulation of risperidone injected into the muscle at 2 week intervals for at least 1 year in patients with these conditions. Assessments of effectiveness include the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) overall severity of illness scale. Quality of life will be assessed by the SF-36 Health Survey. Safety evaluations include incidence of adverse events, physical examinations, and evaluations of the injection site, clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS), a scale assessing muscle tone, gain, and abnormal movements. Injections every 2 weeks for at least 1 year, beginning at 25milligrams[mg] and increasing to 50mg or 75mg (maximum dose). Dosages may be increased or decreased at investigator's discretion. During the first 3 weeks, risperidone tablets (2mg) once daily to supplement injectable risperidone., Schizophrenia|intramuscular injection|psychotropic agents|long-acting risperidone
2	A Safety and Efficacy Study of Bacopa Monnieri and Nardostachys Jatamansi to Treat Schizophrenia, At present, there is no clearly effective treatment of Schizophrenia, which is present in 1% of the population. While acute psychotic episodes are well-controlled with modern medicines, long-term prognosis in terms of quality of life and productivity remain poor. In India, more than 50% of beds in mental hospitals is taken up by Schizophrenic patients, without much of cost-benefit outcome.In clinical practice, Ayurvedic treatment has proved to be effective and well-accepted in patients of Schizophrenia, is safe on long-term use, and may bring about the desired long-term positive changes in patient-health outcome.||In this proposed project, 200 patients of Schizophrenia will be recruited from the local and regional psychiatric institutions. The patients will be in the age group from 18-60 and of either sex. Patients suffering from any organic disorder will not be included in the study. Patients having any concomitant drug addiction will also not be included. Each patient and a close relative (as guardian) will be required to sign a consent form, for the clinical trial, in the regional language. Full, written information about the proposed clinical trial will be given to the patient and relatives. All information will be available in English and two regional languages, viz. Hindi and Marathi. Full detailed history and clinical examination of all patients will be done. Each patient will be interviewed with the Structured Clinical Interview for Axis I DSM-IV Disorders (SCID).Diagnosis of Schizophrenia will be done using the DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria for Schizophrenia (from American Psychiatric Association:- Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - 2000). This will also include classification of longitudinal course in patients having more than 1 year's duration of onset of active-phase symptoms. The clinical profile of each patient will be evaluated using the Positive and Negative Symptom scale for Schizophrenia. This is a structured clinical interview (SCI-PANSS) having 30 items which rate along a seven point continuum (1 = absent; 7 = extreme severe). The assessment provides separate scores in nine clinical domains including a positive syndrome, a negative syndrome, depression, a composite index, and general psychopathology. The SCI-PANSS will be used for each patient initially for baseline evaluation before commencing treatment and later, once in 3 months, to provide assessment of treatment response. The patients will be divided at random into 2 groups of 100 each, one a study group and the other a control group. A brief wash-out period of 2 weeks will be given to patients already taking some medication. The study group will be given Ayurvedic medicine in the dose of 2 tablets b.i.d. of BM, and 1tablet b.i.d. of NJ; with each 350 mg. tablet containing 200mg of aqueous extract . This dosage is in accordance with prevalent use of the above two herbs, in adults. The control group will be given a standard anti-psychotic drug Olanzapine, 10 mg. o.d.||Patients will be dispensed Ayurvedic medicine or anti-psychotic for 4 weeks and then reassessed at every visit. Basic clinical examination and clinical changes will be noted. Baseline SGPT/B. Urea/ S. Creatinine will be done for all patients and repeated every 6 months, to assess any possible drug toxicity. The progress of the patients will be carefully monitored for a total period of 78 weeks each, with a watch for any possible signs of drugs toxicity, treatment failure or aggravation of symptoms., Schizophrenia|Herbal extracts|Randomized|Controlled|Clinical Trial
0	Feasibility and Pilot Study of a Rule-based Chatbot Application for Adolescents With Anxiety Symptoms, Anxiety is one of the most common psychiatric disorders and the anxiety symptoms typically onsets in adolescence. The anxiety symptoms may be persistent into adulthood, leading to a poorer life quality and function impairments. The goal is to prevent the development of anxiety and comorbid disorders, as well as function impairment due to anxiety symptoms. This study wishes to investigate the feasibility and preliminary clinical effects of a digital intervention in an open pre-post and 3 months follow up study. The intervention consists of a rule-based click-chatbot, combined with therapist-guidance. This study will recruit N = 30 adolescents from age 13 up to 16 years old to investigate the feasibility and preliminary clinical effects of a rule-based click chatbot-intervention, and whether it causes a reduction in anxiety symptoms and increases of life functioning. If the intervention is feasible with promising results, the study will serve as a first step to a future randomized controlled trial., Adolescents|Anxiety|Chatbot intervention|Technology-delivered intervention
2	"Cognitive Remediation Program for Family Caregivers in Schizophrenia, Context and justification It has been shown that when patient's family commits to a psycho-educational programme, the relapse rate of the patients themselves is halved to an equivalent level to that of drug treatment. Cognitive disorders affect 80% of patients with schizophrenia and have deleterious consequences on their autonomy and daily functioning. Cognitive remediation has now clearly demonstrated its effectiveness in the management of these cognitive disorders, particularly with regard to compensatory approaches that aim modifying the environment and providing external support. However, access to cognitive remediation remains extremely limited. It is only available in a limited number of specialized centres. In order to allow a better access to these cognitive remediation methods and to maintain its effects over time, the objective of this research project is to develop a web-based intervention, the Cognitive Adaptative Training for Caregivers (""CAT famille""), aimed at accompanying and guiding family carers via an internet video chat with a psychologist to implement cognitive remediation techniques of compensatory approach directly into their sick relative living home.||Main and secondary objectives The main objective is to evaluate the impact of a web-based intervention aimed at training a family caregiver in cognitive remediation techniques using a compensatory approach on the daily life functioning of his/her family member suffering from schizophrenia. Secondary objectives are to assess improvement in: 1) caregiver burden, 2) caregiver and patient quality of life, 3) negative symptoms, and 4) patient compliance.||Methodology This is a comparative, prospective, randomized study including two groups of (patient/caregiver) dyads: 1) an intervention group consisting of a (patient + family carer) dyad benefiting, in addition to the usual treatment, from the intervention for the family carer, and 2) a group consisting of a (patient + caregiver) dyad with usual care (control group).||Control group: Psycho-education manual, with a weekly reading module and a 15-minute webcam feedback by the psychologist.||Intervention group: Family CAT manual, with a module each week to be read according to the patient's objectives and a 15-minute webcam feedback by the psychologist.||For all groups:||Before intervention: Neuropsychological assessment + home assessment of the environment and the performance of daily living activities by psychologist A.||After intervention: Home assessment of the environment and the performance of daily living activities by psychologist B.||The inclusion criteria are: 1) for patients: patients with schizophrenia, aged 18 to 50, who can read, understand and speak French, 2) for parents: understand, speak and read French. The main outcome will be the assessment of the patient's daily life functioning as measured by the Life Skills Profile.||Process:||Total number of visits and follow-up: 3 visits during a prospective follow-up over 10 months Duration of inclusions: 18 months and duration of statistical analysis/valuation: 3-6 months||Feasibility:||The University Service of Adult Psychiatry of the University Hospital of Montpellier is one of the schizophrenia expert centres of the Fondamental network. SUPA has proven expertise in the field of cognitive remediation (see PRME Grecco in progress). SUPA works in collaboration with the family carers of people diagnosed with schizophrenia, in particular through the Profamille program (psychoeducation for carers) and UNAFAM.||Outcomes / Perspectives:||The management of cognitive disorders is essential in the care of patients with schizophrenia, in combination with other types of therapies. This research, aimed at training family carers in the use of compensatory cognitive remediation techniques that require little knowledge of neuropsychology, will be of direct benefit to patients. The expected results will contribute to the optimization of management by demonstrating that intervention and training of relatives in compensatory cognitive techniques will improve functional autonomy., schizophrenia|remediation|cognitive"

1	Clinical and Genetic Study of Autism Spectrum Disorder, Autism is a pervasive neurodevelopmental disorder with prominent reciprocal social and communication impairment and restricted repetitive behavior or interest. Based on the number of symptoms and functional impairment, autistic disorder, Asperger disorder, and atypical autism (or PDDNOS) are conceptualized as the autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Most recent survey estimated the prevalence of narrow diagnosis of autistic disorder to be around 0.1% to 0.2%, and 0.59 % to 0.63% for ASD, with a four-fold male predominance. Due to high heritability (> 0.9), high family recurrence risk (λ = 60), and severe impairment without effective prevention and treatment available for ASD, this disastrous disease has been prioritized for molecular genetic study from public health perspective. The proposed research is the first systematic approach combining clinical and molecular genetic study of ASD involving multi-sites and three research cores: assessment core (by Gau SS and Wu YY), molecular genetics core (by Chen CH), and data/statistics core (by Gau SS).||The long-term objective of this study is to establish clinical and genetic database of autism and their family for etiology study, exploration of pathogenesis, and developing new treatment. The specific aims are:||to establish the psychometric properties of three Chinese versions of rating scales for ASD: SCQ, SRS, and ABC;|to collect clinical, neuropsychological, and genetic data of ASD probands and their family and|to identify the genetic variants close to etiological genes of ASD in a Taiwanese sample using candidate gene case-control association study design (e.g., Neuroligin gene family, MeCP2 gene, and FOXP2 gene, parent trio and population-based studies) and whole genome linkage analysis for multiplex families.||After well-preparation of instruments, DNA collection procedure, and assessor's training in the first 6 months, we will recruit 40, 170, and 90 ASD families in the first, second, and third year of the project, respectively. The instruments include the ADI-R, ADOS, K-SADS-E, SCQ, SRS, and ABC for measuring autistic psychopathology; WISC-III, MSEL and PPVT for cognitive ability; CPT, CANTAB, and WCST for neuropsychological functioning, and MRI, MRS, and DSI for brain imaging study.||We anticipate the establishment of the database of 300 ASD families, completion of the mutation screening of several candidate genes, and determination of their association with ASD and its intermediate phenotype in our sample. The identification of susceptible genes for ASD would be a major breakthrough in child psychiatry because this revelation would facilitate the scientific diagnosis of autism and as a result, it would shed light on the pathogenesis of autism and contribute to the development of the novel, specific and effective treatment of this devastating disease., autism spectrum disorder|family genetic study|gene|phenotype|endophenotype
1	"Basic Body Awareness Therapy for Persons With Autism, Introduction Movement quality is a concept that describes how movements are performed in space, time and amount of energy. When the quality is good, the movement is perceived as unrestricted and gives a sense of freedom, physically and mentally. Movement quality and body awareness are dependent on each other. Body awareness is the ability to be consciously present and interpret signals from your own body. A physiotherapeutic treatment method that describes how movement quality and body awareness interact on a deeper level is Basic Body Awareness Therapy (BBAT).||The purpose of BBAT is to raise physical and mental awareness by strengthening the interplay between sensory impressions and motor ability, gaining knowledge of movement patterns and habits that are not functional. Man's ability to perceive, take care of, control and use the body in a functional manner affects the quality and expression of the movements. According to the theory behind BBAT, movement quality and body awareness are both important abilities to develop bodily self-consciousness.||In order to distinguish between oneself and others, ability to gather and make conscious sensory impressions through the body is demanded. In order to understand the impressions and the world around us, one need to be able to integrate sensory impressions to each other into an information with deeper meaning, the creation of perceptual coherence. The perceptual coherence is the basis for knowledge of one's own body and movement quality. Body awareness increases with more experience of movement. based on the physiotherapeutic bodyself, the subjective (""I as my body"") and objective (""I in my body"") identity we use to meet and understand the world. The bodyself comes to expression through the degree of movement quality and can as such be observed.||When people with autism grow up, their development differs from typically developed peers. They may find it difficult to understand that other people have their own thoughts and feelings, so-called theory of mind and to understand their own feelings and inner states. They may lack central coherence, being able to merge details to the whole. They may also react differently to smells, flavors, sounds or materials carried on the body, having difficulty imitating others, have less flexibility to achieve motion targets, have poorer motor skills and/or sensorimotor function. In autism, the ability for multi-sensory integration is often inadequate. In this way, context and meaning can become less comprehensible and meaningful. This can lead to changes in the bodyself.||As children with autism exhibit worse body awareness and movement quality than children with typical development, it may be likely that body and movement experiences are reduced through upbringing. This can affect physical and mental health, as seen in autism. A study from 1991 examined how young adults with autism describe how movement quality from a body function perspective affects their ability to maintain daily activities and participation. The attention it required of the individual to attempt to master stereotyped movements to be considered ""normal"", resulted in increased mental energy utilization as they constantly watched their own behavior, also creating anxiety. In a previous study we interviewed eleven young adults with autism about their experiences about body and movement, as well as examined them with one motor and one body awareness instrument. The results showed conflicting feelings about their bodies and movements, but also how movement quality was related to the way the individual had access to functional strategies to handle everyday situations or not. There is little knowledge about the effects of various interventions that focus on body awareness and movement quality in this group.||The objective of this study is to investigate effects of a BBAT intervention for young adults with autism. Research question: Can an intervention with BBAT help young adults with autism to improve their movement qualities in everyday activities and achieve individually expressed need to improve?||Participants The participants will be young adults with autism, living in the region of Skaraborg in Västra Götaland or in the region of Kronoberg. See 10. Eligibility criteria.||All patients with autism, within the criteria, that has been examined with BAS MQ-E may be eligible for participation in this study. Individual needs for improvement are discussed with each individual. If relevant needs are expressed, which may be encountered with BBAT, and the patient is motivated for intervention, he/she will be included in the study following informed consent. The expressed individual need will be defined in a statement, such as ""I experience muscle tensions"" or ""I can calm myself before bedtime"". The intervention will start within one month after performing BAS MQ-E and administered individually. A control group is used within the patient group. With a significance level of 0.05, a power of 0.8 and a moderate effect, at least 20 participants are calculated for in the intervention and control groups respectively.||Ethics The study is approved by The Regional ethical review board in Gothenburg (Dnr 651-17).||Instruments Numeric rating scale Individually expressed health problem is estimated on an individualized 11-degree numeric rating scale (NRS). See 9. Outcome measures.||BAS MQ-E Movement quality will be examined with Body Awareness Scale Movement Quality and Experience (BAS MQ-E). See 9. Outcome measures.||Methods A pragmatic randomized controlled study, pRCT, will be conducted. Participants are jointly managed for Skaraborg and Kronoberg and randomized to intervention group and control group. The distribution is managed by an independent person. Randomization takes place by using a random generator function at http://gallerit.se/slumptal/, with numbers 1 and 2. All 1 means that the participant is randomized to the intervention group, all 2 to the control group.||Intervention group: The layout is individualized based on the results of BAS MQ-E, all three parts. The individually expressed health problem is estimated on the NRS scale. After assessment, 12 occasions are given with BBAT approximately once a week (3-4 months).||Control group: Treatment as usual for 3-4 months. Individualized NRS estimation and assessment with BAS MQ-E are performed according to flowchart. The participant will then have access to BBAT if they wish.||Data collection BAS MQ-E (1) used in the study has been collected either from a previous validation study or from everyday clinic. BAS MQ-E (2), parts Movement test and Questionnaire, will be performed maximum 1 month after the end of the intervention by an independent examiner. Own rating of the individualized health problem using the VAS will be performed prior to the intervention (1), after 7 occasions of intervention (2) and maximum 2 months after last occasion of intervention at 12 weeks, approximately 20 weeks total (3).||Data analysis The primary outcome measure are the results from the NRS ratings. Further, the scores from BAS MQ-E, parts Movement test and Questionnaire, as secondary outcome measure. ANOVA will be used for statistical analysis of differences for repeated measures prior to, during and after the intervention. The intervention- and control groups will be analyzed to each other for any statistical significant difference using Mann Whitney U test (significance level p<0,05).||Clinical significance of the study Body and movements are often described as problems in persons with autism. But it omits that there are also resources in the body to find strategies for everyday life. By strengthening body functions and enhancing movement quality and body awareness through a body therapy intervention, the person with autism can better understand themselves. Strengthened body functions then provide the basis for the individual's opportunities for development and increased participation in society. Expected results thus follow the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, i.e. to eliminate obstacles for people with disabilities to enjoy their human rights and participation, in full and equal to others., Autism|Movement|Body-mind therapy|Physiotherapy"

2	Efficacy of Lu 31-130 in Patients With Schizophrenia, Schizophrenia is a serious and disabling mental disorder that affects approximately 1% of the world's population. Antipsychotic drugs remain the cornerstone in the pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia. However, none of the available drugs is ideal, in particular because of their complex safety profile and the limited effectiveness against certain symptoms of the disease. Thus, only one dimension of the morbidity, that is, the positive symptoms, can be expected to respond to treatment whereas negative symptoms and cognitive deficits are, at best, only marginally targeted.||Given this, there is no doubt that the current antipsychotic drugs leave much room for improvement and call for new, more effective pharmacotherapies in the treatment of schizophrenia. In the current study, patients suffering from schizophrenia and experiencing clinically significant symptoms of the disease will be included. In the current study, eligible patients will be randomised in a 2:1 ratio to blinded treatment with either Lu 31-130 (3, 5, 7, 10 or 14 mg/day) or placebo for 8 weeks. The study includes 5 parts with increasing doses of Lu 31-130 (Part A [3 mg/day], B [5 mg/day], C [7 mg/day], D [10 mg/day], and E [14 mg/day]). A decision to initiate Part B [5 mg/day of Lu 31-130], C [7 mg/day of Lu 31-130] or D [10 mg/day of Lu 31-130] will be based on safety and tolerability of the previous study part. Dependent on the safety, tolerability and PK data from Part D the study may proceed with Part E. The efficacy and the safety of Lu 31-130 will be evaluated in comparison to the pooled placebo group from all 5 study parts., Schizophrenia|Antipsychotic|Lu 31-130

Excessive student anxiety is a common problem that severely impairs short and long term academic functioning and increases teacher burden. Conversely, reducing student anxiety has been associated with improvement in educational functioning. Because anxiety manifests daily in the classroom, teachers are in an ideal position to identify and help students manage their anxiety. One universal intervention for anxiety reduction exists, but its feasibility and efficacy are not established. The aims of this project are to address this gap in teacher training. Specifically, the aims of this proposal include: Aim 1) to develop the Teacher Anxiety Program for Elementary Students (TAPES) and assess its usability, acceptability and feasibility; Aim 2) to determine whether teachers can implement TAPES with high fidelity and quality; Aim 3) to examine the impact of TAPES, compared to a standard professional development condition, on teacher a) knowledge and b) use of anxiety reduction strategies with students with excessive anxiety (Primary Outcomes); and Aim 4) to examine the impact of TAPES on student outcomes. Exploratory aims will examine the mediators, predictors, and moderators of TAPES impact on teachers' knowledge and skill. If effective, TAPES has the potential to directly benefit: 1) teachers--by providing training in an important and relevant, but neglected area that will enhance their professional development and effectiveness in the classroom; and 2) children--by reducing their anxiety and improving their educational, social, and behavioral functioning.||Description of TAPES: The proposed teacher training is appropriate for elementary teachers to enhance their capacity to support students with excessive anxiety. The training includes one full day of instruction, materials to use with individual students and their parents (in 5 meetings), and guidelines for classroom-wide strategies to reduce anxiety. The section below describes 1) the content of the teacher training and supportive empirical evidence, 2) how this training differs from current teacher practices for anxious students, 3) a proposed theory of teacher and child behavior change and 4) evidence supporting the feasibility of implementing TAPES in an authentic school environment. This teacher training is not intended to replace or change the role of existing mental health providers or other members of schools' interdisciplinary teams. Given that teachers are members of an interdisciplinary team, the study team will obtain input from school personnel to ensure that the teacher-training fits within the goals/mission of the interdisciplinary team.||Description of TAPES content: Overview: The primary goal of TAPES is to enhance teachers' capacity to identify and reduce anxiety in their students. Toward this end, the proposed content of TAPES consists of three core components: 1) training in evidenced-based anxiety reduction strategies that teachers will implement to identify and assist specific anxious students and classroom-wide strategies helpful to all students, 2) evidenced-based material for teachers to review with parents regarding how to reduce student anxiety at home, thus improving school-home communication and shared goals and 3) training in how to conduct conjoint teacher-parent-student meetings to improve the quality of the teacher-parent-student relationship. Each component is described below.||Training and Evidence Related to Child Anxiety Reduction Skills: Teachers will learn skills based on cognitive behavioral strategies (CBT) including relaxation training (to reduce physiological arousal), behavioral strategies (e.g., ""exposure"" or facing anxiety provoking situations which lowers anxiety via new learning), addressing maladaptive thoughts that maintain anxiety, and problem solving skills. To implement these new skills with specific children teachers will be trained to use a school-home journal that includes a type of daily report card that tracks behavioral exposures and use a reward system for increasing brave behavior /adaptive coping skills.). These ""common elements"" of CBT are powerful agents of change and have been implemented by CBT experts and non-experts. As such, these skills are established and empirically-supported; however, they have not been evaluated when delivered by teachers.||Teachers will also receive training in effective classroom-based accommodations that may be needed (e.g. untimed testing) or may need to be gradually faded if they are maintaining anxiety through negative reinforcement (e.g. allowing child to avoid participating in class due to anxiety). Another component of the teacher training includes skills that teachers deliver to their classroom (i.e., such as leading the entire class in a relaxation exercise prior to an exam; teacher using a coping model or teacher reducing their accommodation of avoidant/anxious behavior for all students). Finally, teachers will be trained in how to modify their own behaviors that have been shown to increase student anxiety (e.g., hostility, over-control). These modifications are also designed to improve the quality of the teacher-student relationship. Research on the role of teacher behavior in the development and/or maintenance of child anxiety suggests that teachers who exhibit highly controlling behaviors, such as issuing frequent directives, tend to increase child anxiety and negatively affect children's ability to learn. Conversely, positive teacher-child relationships have been found to protect youth from developing internalizing behavior problems over time. Consequently, TAPES aims to modify these teacher behaviors.||Training and Evidence Related to Conjoint Parent-Teacher-Student Meetings. Training teachers in conducting conjoint meetings will enhance teachers' ability to formalize mechanisms for sharing information about anxiety reduction and will enhance communication and relationship quality between parent, teacher, and student. Training in these conjoint meeting will also allow the teacher to clarify roles and responsibilities with respect to helping the child, and devise a collaborative plan with similar language and tools to facilitate generalization of skills between school and home. Implementation of this component will involve approximately 5 conjoint-30 minute meetings over an 8 week period. During these meetings, parents, students, and teachers will create and modify anxiety hierarchies, mutually decide on practice tasks, and develop a contingency management plan. Target behaviors are individualized based on the needs of the child (e.g., raising a hand to answer a question in class for a child with social anxiety; separating from parents for a child with separation anxiety). These meetings can be supplemented by phone and email contacts between teacher and parents/students as needed.||TAPES Training Format and Implementation: Students' primary teacher will participate in a one-day training (approximately 6 hours). One of the most important strategies for ensuring that TAPES is implemented with high fidelity is appropriate training and ongoing consultation. Training strategies will be based on published guidelines and will include active/experiential learning strategies, opportunities for observation (via video clips), live modeling and role plays, and coached practice. Ongoing performance feedback and consultation has been found to enhance learning and is related to higher fidelity. Thus, teachers will be offered 30-minutes of weekly consultation by the PIs for each active TAPES students. Consultation will include case review, skill rehearsal, problem-solving obstacles, and feedback regarding performance based on audiotaped sessions. Meetings will be held in person, over the phone, or via Skype at times convenient for teachers. After each teacher identifies their first child, the PIs will attend one conjoint meeting in order to provide performance feedback (all conjoint meetings are audiotaped for fidelity). The PIs will also provide in classroom coaching for 30-minutes for each student enrolled. Training materials will be available on the internet or thumb drive for reference.||Research Plan Overview: Design and Methods. This three-year development project consists of 3 stages. Stage one (months 1-6) involves establishing a Development Team (DT) that will review the initial draft of TAPES and provide feedback to ensure that TAPES is acceptable to teachers and feasible for the school setting. Stage two (months 7-20) involves two successive open trials of the TAPES protocol with 15 teachers and 20 children. This stage will allow for ""trial runs"" of the training to assess feasibility, acceptability and utility of the training. Data and qualitative feedback gleaned during the first open trial will inform modifications for the second open trial. The investigators will present and discuss data with the DT after each open trial. Study staff will also ask 5 teachers from open trial 1 to test out the revisions for open trial 2. Based on knowledge gained in this stage, appropriate modifications will be made for stage three. Stage three (months 21-34) involves a pilot Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) using a randomized controlled design comparing TAPES to the Teacher Anxiety Training (TAT). TAT (developed by the PIs for use in other studies and described below) will be used to represent ""typical"" teacher professional development training. The RCT will be conducted in three phases. Phase 1 consists of recruiting, randomizing, and training teachers in either TAPES or TAT. Also during this phase (but after the training), teachers will recruit anxious children and study staff will screen and evaluate them to determine eligibility. In Phase 2 teachers will implement TAPES or TAT. Phase 3 involves a post-intervention (after 8 weeks) and a three-month follow-up assessment of the primary (teacher behavior) and secondary (child) outcomes. Trained independent evaluators (IEs) will assess primary outcomes (teacher behavior). The culmination of these iterative stages will be a final version of the training that will be ready for evaluation in a larger efficacy trial.||Detailed Description of Each Stage Stage 1: Establish DT and refine initial version of the TAPES Protocol. The DT will strive to ensure that the teacher training will be acceptable, feasible, and usable in the school setting. The DT will consist of the PIs, two national experts in teacher training, two experts in school-home collaborative interventions, and two experts in training school-based personnel in CBT techniques for anxious youth. A CT school psychologist and two CT elementary teachers will complete the DT. DT members will provide detailed feedback about the TAPES strategies, study methods/measures, perceived barriers to successful implementation and adoption by teachers, and solutions to potential barriers. Information from this meeting will be used to revise the protocol in preparation for the first open trial as well as successive phases of the study.||Stage 2: Open Trials. During Stage 2, teachers and IEs will be trained, and the study team will conduct two sequential open trials. Study staff will engage in screening activities of students and IEs will complete baseline evaluations on referred students. The purpose of the open trials is to evaluate the feasibility of the training, modify methods as needed, allow teachers to implement the skills learned in the training and receive real time coaching and consultation with anxious children. Data on TAPES usability, acceptability, fidelity, satisfaction, and teacher and child outcomes will also be collected. After each open trial, feedback (via exit interviews and standardized measures) from teachers, students, and parents will be integrated by the research team and presented to the DT for another revision of the protocol. Teachers will be asked to participate in an exit interview after they implement TAPES with an anxious child.||Stage 3: Pilot RCT. In stage 3, the study team will conduct a pilot RCT with 40 teachers and a maximum of 60 anxious youth. The RCT will be conducted in 3 phases.||Phase 1 - Recruitment, Randomization, Training, Student Screening, and Baseline Evaluations: In Phase 1, teachers will be randomly selected from the pool of interested participants and randomized to TAPES or TAT. Once randomized, teachers will complete their assigned training. Teachers will then identify potentially eligible students from their classes and provide information about the study to their parents. Interested parents will contact study staff and complete a brief phone screen. Students who appear eligible based on the phone screen (e.g., have elevated anxiety; are in elementary school) will be invited to complete informed consent and a full baseline evaluation with an IE. Families who meet criteria on the baseline evaluation will be considered eligible (see Inclusion/Exclusion criteria).||Phase 2 - TAPES/TAT Implementation: Teachers will implement TAPES or TAT depending on their random assignment over 8 weeks from child enrollment.||Phase 3 - Post- and Follow-up Evaluations: At the end of the 8 weeks, teachers and children in both groups will complete a post evaluation. Teachers, students, and parents will complete a TAPES satisfaction measure and provide feedback to enhance the protocol. Teachers will complete an exit interview. Students who need mental health services will be referred to the school counselor or community provider for treatment. A 3 month follow-up evaluation to assess sustained use of TAPES/TAT skills will be conducted., Excessive Anxiety|Teacher Training|Elementary School|School-based|Effectiveness Research|Randomized Controlled Trial"
1	Treatment of Children With Autism Spectrum Disorders and Epileptiform EEG With Divalproex Sodium, Epilepsy and epileptiform EEG abnormalities are common co-morbidities in Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) that can be considered important biomarkers of cortical dysfunction in these disorders. They may represent a measure of the excitatory-inhibitory imbalance posited to be involved in the pathogenesis of the disorder. Treatment of epilepsy is always indicated, but treatment of isolated epileptiform EEG (i.e. in the absence of clinical seizures) is frankly controversial. Since data suggest that these epileptiform discharges are associated with deficits in attention, language and behavior, the investigators believe that they may represent an important and novel treatment target in this population. The proposed study brings together a group of investigators long interested in this problem in order to investigate the efficacy of using an anticonvulsant medication with spike suppression capabilities (VPA in the form of divalproex sodium) to treat children with ASD and isolated epileptiform EEGs. Recruiting from 3 large autism centers (Boston Children's Hospital (BCH) and Vanderbilt University (VU) and University of Louisville (U of L)) with very large pediatric epilepsy units, the investigators propose a 26 week randomized placebo controlled cross over study of VPA in 4-8 year old children with ASD with frequent epileptiform EEG discharges., Abnormal EEGs
0	Effect of Different Doses of Dexmedetomidine on Cerebral Oxygen Saturation and Postoperative Anxiety in Elderly Patients, A total of 105 patients who were admitted to The First Hospital of Qinhuangdao for laparoscopic surgery and divided into control group (group C), dexmedetomidine doses of 0.2 μg/kg (group D1), dexmedetomidine doses of 0.5 μg/kg (group D2).||105 patients were randomized equally into 3 groups. 35 cases in each group. Group C received general anesthesia without dexmedetomidine, groups D1 received general anesthesia with intravenous pump of 0. 2μg/kg/h dexmedetomidine, groups D2 received general anesthesia with intravenous pump of 0. 5μg/kg/h dexmedetomidine.SBP(Systolic Blood Pressure),DP(Diastolic Pressure),HR(Heart Rate) and rScO2(Regional cerebral oxygen saturation) of the three groups were recorded before anesthesia induction (T1), at the time of intubation (T2), five minutes after induction(T3),at the beginning of surgery (T4), immediately after surgery (T5), and five minutes after extubation (T6).||The cognitive function of the three groups was assessed with the Mini Mental State Scale (MMSE) on the day before surgery. the anxiety of the three groups was assessed with Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) on the day before surgery,one day after and three days after surgery, comparing the incidence of anxiety between the three groups.

The study consists of 4 phases: a Screening Phase (up to 3 weeks); a 17-week flexible dose open-label Transition Phase (open-label phase means that all people know the identity of the intervention); a 12-week fixed dose open-label Maintenance Phase; and a randomized, double-blind, fixed dose, placebo-controlled relapse prevention phase (referred to as the Double-blind Phase). Patients who meet specific stabilization criteria will enter the Double-blind Phase at Week 29. Patients will be randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive either a fixed dose of PP3M or placebo. The Double-blind Phase will be of variable duration; patients will remain in the study until they experience a relapse event or meet discontinuation criteria., Schizophrenia|R092670|Paliperidone Palmitate|Paliperidone palmitate 3 month formulation (PP3M)
2	Anti-Inflammatory Treatment of Schizophrenia, Schizophrenia has been hypothesized to be due, in part, to disruptions of normal immune system and inflammatory responses to viral or bacterial infections or other stimuli of these systems. Epidemiological and clinical studies have provided extensive evidence that perinatal exposure to infection contributes to the etiology of schizophrenia. The recent reports of associations between markers of single nucleotide polymorphisms located within the major histocompatibility complex on chromosome 6p22.1 and schizophrenia provide further support for etiological hypotheses of immune system dysfunction in schizophrenia.||There are a large number of reports that suggest that people with schizophrenia have altered cytokine levels, with one or more studies reporting elevated levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines: IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12, CRP, IFN-γ, and TNF-α; and reduced levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine: IL-10. In this study we examine the use of combination anti-inflammatory therapy as an intervention in patients with schizophrenia. We will use||Salsalate, 4 gm/day. Salsalate is a potent inhibitor of nuclear transcription factor NF-κB activation. NF-κB is activated by pro-inflammatory cytokines;|Omega-3-fatty acids eicosapentaenoic (EPA; 2 gm/day) and docosahexaenoic (DHA; 2 gm/day). Omega-3-fatty acids exert their anti-inflammatory effects through their oxygenation into resolvins or protectins, which are potent anti-inflammatory agents;|Fluvastatin, 40 mgs/day. Fluvastatin is a lipid-lowering drugs, which acts through the inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA). Fluvastatin may also exert anti-inflammatory effects independent of its lipid-lowering effects via a mechanism involving HMG-CoA inhibition and decreased NF-κB activation.||We have chosen to use combination therapy with three different classes of anti-inflammatory agents to address the potential benefit of this therapeutic approach for persistent positive symptoms and cognitive impairments. The three agents have unique anti-inflammatory mechanisms of action, which we believe offers the most robust evaluation of this therapeutic approach and maximizes the likelihood of eliciting pronounced therapeutic effects., schizophrenia|anti-inflammatory|salsalate|statins|omega-3-fatty acids
2	A Long-Term Study of JNS007ER in Patients With Schizophrenia, This is a 48-week, multicenter, open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), non-controlled, arbitrary-dose study. The patients included in this study are those who participated in the preceding double-blind (neither physician nor patient knows the treatment that the patient receives) comparative trial (study JNS007ER-JPN-S31) of JNS007ER and completed the study, or those who remained in the study up to the evaluation at 2 weeks and discontinued the study after that for insufficient treatment efficacy. The study will assess the safety of JNS007ER in the clinical recommended dose range in a long term treatment. The dosage will be started at 6 mg/day, and it can be increased or decreased 3 mg at a time depending on the patient's symptom within the range of 3 mg/day to 12 mg/day. For dose adjustments, the investigator will evaluate the psychiatric symptoms before defining the dose change.||Detailed Description: Extended description of the protocol, including more technical information (as compared to the Brief Summary) if desired.

Several peer-reviewed publications have described the use of magic to help encourage the recovery of motor skills 2. Green et al. reported that after the completion of an intense 2-week magic-theme summer camp, patients with spastic hemiplegia significantly increased the usage of their affected hand 3. Another investigation sought to study if magic could be used to aid in communication with mentally-disabled children 4. This study concluded that magic was effective in building trust, improving the subjects' self-esteem, and enriching their interpersonal skills.||Magic has also been partially studied in a surgical context for relieving perioperative anxiety. One study sought to evaluate the efficacy of clowns (whose performance included magic tricks) in relieving perioperative anxiety 5. Patients that were undergoing surgical procedures were placed in either a clown group or non-clown group. These patients were not grouped based on surgical procedures, and patients were included that were undergoing one of ten different surgeries. Anxiety levels of the pediatric patients were measured in the waiting room and induction room immediately prior to anesthesia administration. Additionally, parent state and trait anxiety was measured during their child's induction using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Health professionals involved in the surgeries were also questioned using a questionnaire developed by the authors to obtain health providers' opinion regarding the presence of clowns as administered in the study. Moreover, clowns filled out a self-evaluation form regarding how they believed their interaction with the child went prior to the surgery. The authors found that the clown group displayed decreased anxiety during anesthesia induction but not in the waiting room. They also documented that health professionals believed the clowns benefitted the child, but at the same time, a majority of the staff discouraged continuance of the program due to interference with operating room procedures.||This study will assess the efficacy of magic therapy services in relieving pediatric patient anxiety and parent anxiety in an inpatient setting. It will also measure family satisfaction with child life services during the hospital visit and health professional opinions regarding such a therapy in an inpatient setting. The primary evaluation method will be through surveys. No prior investigations have studied using magic therapy as a primary tool to improve the psychological well-being of pediatric patients over the span of an inpatient hospitalization. Study and improvement of magic therapy services provides an evidence-based approach to improve pediatric patient psychological well-being, assist physicians in obtaining pediatric patient cooperation with procedures, and improving the hospitalization experience for the family of hospitalized pediatric patients., Magic|Anxiety|Pediatric

2	The Effect of a Community-based LAT-treated Management Model on the Violence Risk of Patients With Schizophrenia, This is a 49 weeks open-label,cluster randomized controlled study. Patients with schizophrenia and violence risk under the government supervision will be enrolled in the study. A community-based long-acting antipsychotics-treated management model will be applied to the experimental group, which means that professional psychiatrists will provide guidance to primary-level mental health workers on the psychotic treatment, and monthly-injected long-acting antipsychotic, paliperidone palmitate, will be used in the schizophrenia treatment. The subjects in experimental group will be injected with 150mg eq and 100mg eq paliperidone palmitate in the deltoid at the 1st and 8th day, and afterwards a flexible dose of paliperidone palmitate from 75 to 150mg eq will be administrated monthly per clinical judgement. For subjects who did not take risperidone, paliperidone extended release tablets, risperidone microspheres or paliperidone palmitate for injection previously, subjects should take oral paliperidone or risperidone sustained release tablets in the screening phase to perform ultra-sensitive test (the minimum dose of risperidone 1 mg/day and the minimum dose of sustained-release tablets paliperidone 3 mg/day, at least orally three days). Only subjects who were judged by the treating physician as tolerance to the drug could usepaliperidone palmitate .Suggest previous antipsychotics could be withdrawn within 4 weeks after first paliperidone palmitate administration , but will follow doctors' clinical judgement. The study protocol does not limit other medication or treatment measures except the injectable paliperidone palmitate. Other medication or treatment measures should be decided by doctors' clinical judgement and align with patients and caregivers.Subjects in control group will be treated and cared as usual., schizophrenia|violence risk|long-acting antipsychotics|community-based

1	"Ziprasidone in Children With Autism: A Pilot Study, I. SPECIFIC AIMS||To investigate the safety of clinical use of ziprasidone in children|To investigate the dosages that have been employed clinically.||II. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE||Ziprasidone, a recently released atypical agent is likely to be as effective as other neuroleptics in treating psychiatric symptoms in children, but may have the considerable health advantage of not causing weight gain. Ziprasidone administration has been associated with prolongation of the QTc interval (mean=20 msec), an electrocardiographic measure of ventricular repolarization (Federal Drug Administration, 2000). There are no reports regarding the use of ziprasidone in autism, and data regarding the safety and efficacy of ziprasidone in children is extremely limited. The only published study of ziprasidone in children found that it was safe and effective in treating Tourette's syndrome in children aged 7 to 17 years of age (Sallee et al, 2000). Because children are being treated with ziprasidone despite a paucity of safety data, it is important to begin to collect and review available data, including that from clinical usage. Some children who receive services within the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Services of Drexel University College of Medicine have been treated with ziprasidone. The charts of the children and adolescents will contain data regarding exposure to ziprasidone and laboratory data and ECG's that can be reviewed to determine whether ziprasidone treatment has been associated with changes in weight, laboratory values and ECG's. We propose to review the charts of patients who have been treated with our services since March 1, 2001 XXX because such patients may have been exposed to ziprasidone (ziprasidone received FDA approval on February 5, 2001).||III. DESIGN AND METHODS||A. Setting: The setting for this study will be the Specialty Clinic for Pervasive Developmental Disorders, part of the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Outpatient Clinic at Eastern Pennsylvania Psychiatric Institute.||B. Subjects: Subjects will be 15 children and adolescents who meet the DSM-IV Criteria for Pervasive Developmental Disorder.||C. Design: This is a 6-week pilot study employing open treatment with ziprasidone. Subjects will be rated at baseline and thereafter assessed weekly.||D. Medication: Subjects will be treated openly with ziprasidone. Should untoward effects occur, the dosage of the medication will be reduced or the medication will be discontinued, as clinically appropriate. Subjects will not receive other concomitant psychotropic medication during the study. Medication will be taken concomitant with food.||Ziprasidone Dosing Strategy: Ziprasidone tablets (5, 10, and 20 mg) will be employed for the study. The dosage range for ziprasidone will be 5 mg/day to 40 mg/day. Every effort will be made to reach and maintain a therapeutic dosage by week four of the treatment phase.||For subjects who weigh less than 25 kg, starting dosage will be 5 mg/every other day. After 3 days, the dosage can be increased to 5 mg. By week 2, subjects can be increased to 20 mg/day. Thereafter, dosage increases can be made in up to 20 mg increments weekly.|For subjects who weigh greater than 25 kg, the starting dosage will be 5 mg/day. After three days, the dosage can be increased to 10 mg/day. By week two, subjects can be increased to 20 mg/day. Thereafter, dosage increases can be made in up to 20 mg increments weekly as needed.||Note: Should 5 mg tablets not be available, the dosing schedule will be altered to have a starting dosage of 10 mg, and dosage increases will be made in 10 mg increments.||F. Measures||Primary efficacy measure: The Clinical Global Impressions (CGI; Psychopharmacology Bulletin, 1985). The efficacy of treatments can be judged on their ability to enhance global functioning, an assessment that is particularly relative in a pilot study. The CGI consists of three global scales measuring severity of illness, global improvement, and drug effect, and has been useful in measuring drug treatment effect in this population (see Campbell and Palij, 1985). The PI and another trained rater will complete this scale. Although only members of the research team generally complete this scale, it will additionally be completed by the subject's parent/caretaker. Having it completed by the parent/caretaker will take only minutes and may result in useful data. This measure will be completed weekly beginning at baseline.|Secondary efficacy measure: Children's Psychiatric Rating Scale (Psychopharmacology Bulletin, 1985). The CPRS was developed by the Psychopharmacology Branch of the NIMH to rate childhood psychopathology. Each of the items is rated from ""1"" (not present) to ""7"" (extremely severe). The first 28 items of this scale require no verbal response on the part of the subject, making them appropriate for rating children and adolescents with Pervasive Developmental Disorder. Of these 28 items, 14 are particularly relevant in autism (see Campbell and Palij, 1985): they assess the symptoms for which drug treatment is indicated including hyperactivity, aggression, self-abusive behavior, temper tantrums, lability of mood, irritability, social withdrawal, and stereotypies. A composite sum of these 14 items, the CPRS-14, will be constructed and employed as a secondary outcome measure, a procedure used by a number of investigators (Anderson et al, 1989; Campbell et al, 1986, 1989, 1993; Findling et al, 1997; Sanchez et al, 1996). We analyzed our data using the CPRS-14; the ICC was 0.8978. In addition, 4 factors derived from these 14 items will be examined. They include: autism, anger/uncooperativeness, hyperactivity, and speech deviance (Overall and Campbell, 1988). This measure will be completed at baseline and at the end of treatment.|Safety measures: (1) A physical exam will be completed at baseline. (2) Height, weight, blood pressure, and pulse will be obtained and recorded at baseline and at each visit during the study. (3) The following laboratory measures will be obtained at baseline and repeated at the end of the treatment phase: complete blood count with differential, liver functions, and electrocardiogram. Serum prolactin will be obtained at baseline and at the end of the treatment phase. These laboratory studies will be repeated at the end of the treatment phase of the study. Any other clinically appropriate tests and evaluations will also be completed whenever needed.||Untoward effects will be measured and recorded at each visit employing the following measures: (1) Dosage Record and Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale (DOTES); (2) Treatment Emergent Symptoms Scale (TESS); (3) Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) (all from Psychopharmacology Bulletin, 1985); and (4) the Neurologic Rating Scale (Simpson and Angus, 1970). The DOTES and TESS measure a wide range of possible untoward effects. The AIMS measures dyskinesias. The Neurologic Rating Scale measures other forms of extrapyramidal effects that can occur with neuroleptics such as dystonias, parkinsonian effects, and akathisia.||G. Procedures: All patients appropriate to the study and their parent/caretakers will be approached and informed consent and assent (in subjects under 14 years) will be obtained. Subjects meeting the Inclusion Criteria, but not the Exclusion Criteria, will enter the baseline period of the study.||Baseline (week 0): Subjects will be rated at baseline employing the CGI and the CPRS.||End of Treatment (week 6): At the end of the treatment period, subjects will again be rated employing the CGI and the CPRS (selected items).||In addition, each subject will be rated on the CGI at each visit so that data from the last visit is available should the subject terminate the study prematurely. If it is known that a subject will terminate the study at a visit before week 6, the subject will be rated with the CGI and the CPRS at that visit.||All safety measures will be completed at each visit. Laboratory measures and EKG will be obtained in the morning.||I. Analysis: This is a pilot study whose purpose is to get initial safety and efficacy data with ziprasidone in children with autism. We will perform an ANOVA, repeated measures, for CGI severity scores, the CPRS-14 and the CPRS factors. Similar analyses will be performed for safety measures including for weight, prolactin and other laboratory measures, and EKG indices., Autism|Pervasive Developmental Disorder|Ziprasidone|Adolescents"
1	Effect of Oculomotor Exercise on Writing Capabilities on Autism, Handwriting is a functional skill that profoundly affects children's academic and psychosocial development. Difficulties in acquiring and applying these skills subsequently lead to problems such as slow writing and illegible written .Such difficulties may have implications on the child's successful participation in school and play activities, potentially leading to problems in academic performance and lowered self-esteem .Therefore, students with handwriting difficulties are especially prone to frustration, disappointment, and under achievement. The aim of our study is to improve handwriting quality of children with ASD., 0
0	Brief Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Anxiety, Anxiety disorders are identified in over 30% of primary care patients and are associated with substantial functional impairment, poor health-related quality of life, and suicide; however, rates of treatment are low. In contrast to advances in improving treatment of depression and posttraumatic stress disorder in VA, far less attention has been given to anxiety disorders. In the absence of VA clinical practice guidelines for anxiety disorders, evidence-based treatment practices are unstandardized in VA primary care and Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an evidence-based intervention for the anxiety disorders but was developed for use in specialty mental health settings and often targets individual anxiety disorders (e.g.generalized anxiety, panic, and social phobia) with diagnosis-specific treatment packages. These interventions are not practical for primary care and CBOC settings where treatment must be brief and focused on reduction of anxiety symptoms rather than targeted anxiety diagnoses. Further complicating the delivery of CBT for anxiety disorders is that repeated exposure to feared cues is considered a critical component of CBT for anxiety but is rarely used in these settings. Providers within VA currently have no standardized options for delivering brief evidence-based psychotherapy for Veterans with anxiety. Although Primary Care Mental Health Integration (PCMHI) and CBOCs increase access to mental health services, VA recognizes the need to deliver mental health services using video to home technology to increase access, decrease barriers (i.e., geographic distance, transportation, travel time, stigma, child care) and provide more Veteran-centric care. VA is pioneering implementation of VA Video Connect to Home (VVC-H) technology in specialty mental health clinics, but VVC-H continues to be rarely used and little is known about the implementation potential of VVC-H to improve psychotherapy access and outcomes in primary care and CBOC settings. In summary, VA needs a flexible evidence-based approach for anxiety that fits within primary care and CBOC settings and offers innovative delivery strategies to increase access to care. Although treatment in PCMHI and CBOC settings must be time-limited, it must also be highly effective. The investigators have developed robust brief CBT (bCBT) interventions and provider support programs for depression and is now seeking to address anxiety using a similar approach. The proposed clinical intervention will use state-of-the-art practices including delivery of services via VVC-H. This open trial seeks to recruit 12 Veterans who have significant anxiety symptoms according to the GAD-7 (standard assessment tool for VA clinical settings). Veterans will be recruited from the Michael E. DeBakey VAMC primary care clinic and affiliated Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs)., brief Cognitive Behavioral Therapy|VA Video Connect to home

2	Effectiveness of an Interactive Educational Website for Improving the Quality of Mental Health Care for People With Schizophrenia, Schizophrenia is a disabling mental disorder that causes hallucinations and delusions in those affected by it. Research has proven that certain treatment methods are more effective in treating schizophrenia than others. However, not everyone with schizophrenia responds to treatment in the same way, and not all physicians use the same treatment methods. Educating individuals with schizophrenia about all treatments available instead of only the treatments they are receiving may improve the quality of care and lead to better correlation between treatment and quality standards. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of an interactive educational website in enhancing discussions about treatment issues and improving the congruence between expected quality of treatment and treatment received among people with schizophrenia.||Participants in this open label study will be randomly assigned to either use the interactive website or read written materials and watch a video. All three sources will contain information about evidence-based treatment recommendations. Both groups will complete a brief interview before performing their assigned tasks. Upon completion of the interview, participants in the written materials/video group will be given the reading material and will watch a 20-minute video. Participants in the web-user group will sit with a laptop computer, answer questions about themselves and their treatment, receive feedback on care that may be inconsistent with current recommendations, and receive suggestions on how to discuss this with their physicians. Participants in clinical settings will be asked to allow their next clinician visit to be audiotaped to assess outcomes. A phone interview will be conducted with all participants 2 months following the intervention to assess treatment satisfaction and other outcomes. Medical records will be reviewed to collect treatment information 6 months before and after the intervention., Patient participation|Patient education|Consumer involvement

2	A Positron Emission Tomography Study of SLV354 in Healthy Subjects and Subjects With Schizophrenia, This is an exploratory, open-label PET study designed to examine the relationship between SLV354 plasma concentration and 5-HT6 receptor occupancy in the brain following single oral doses of SLV354 in healthy male subjects and male subjects with stable schizophrenia. A total of up to 22 subjects are to complete the study, including approximately 12 subjects with schizophrenia on a stable dose of an atypical antipsychotic medication. Within 60 days prior to the PET scan, subjects will be screened based on medical history, physical examination, vital signs, ECG, clinical laboratory tests, response to Columbia-Suicide-Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) and for schizophrenia subjects only, the diagnosis of schizophrenia based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition-Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR). Following Screening, eligible subjects will have a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan, unless one was performed within one year of the PET scan, to delineate the region of interest for the individual PET images. The radiotracer [11C]-QUICS will be used for the PET scans.||All subjects will receive a single oral dose of SLV354. Healthy subjects will have one PET scan prior to and two PET scans after administration of SLV354. Schizophrenia subjects will have two PET scans prior to and one PET scan after administration of SLV354., 0
2	"Familial Schizophrenia and Spectrum Personality Disorders, Specific aims of the proposed study are:||To test the hypothesis that abnormalities in predictive pursuit, antisaccade performance, working memory, visual attention (CPT), sensory gating (PPI and P50) and other measures of information processing mark the liability for schizophrenia. Secondly, we will examine the pattern of familial aggregation of these measures to determine whether observed deficits are likely to reflect genetic and/or environmental effects. The hypothesis will be supported if (a) the frequency of these neurophysiological deficits is higher in relatives of schizophrenic probands than in relatives of control probands; (b) the prevalence of neurophysiological abnormalities is higher in case relatives with SSP symptoms than in nonSSP case relatives; (c) risk is increased among case relatives of ""affected"" probands vs. case relatives of ""unaffected"" probands (i.e., risk in relatives of case probands who exhibit an abnormality vs. relatives of case probands who do not).|To test the hypothesis that some physiological deficits reflect a common underlying phenotype, while others mark independent aspects of disease risk. To test this hypothesis (a) we will examine correlation matrices (adjusted for within family correlation) for neurophysiological assessments among case relatives and control relatives. Factor structures in the two groups will be examined using exploratory factor analyses, followed by confirmatory factor analyses using validation samples of case/control relatives. Confirmatory Factor Analyses (CFA) will also be used to determine how factor solutions based on case/control relatives fit the data of case probands. (b) Factor scores for correlated measures will be derived and the familial risk for composite measures of neurophysiological functioning estimated using the methods described in Specific Aim 1. (c) Secondary within family analyses will be performed to estimate the heritability of derived factor scores and to determine whether patterns of familial correlations suggest a genetic or environmental cause.|To evaluate whether particular domains of psychopathology are marked by different putative phenotypic markers. We will specifically test the hypotheses that predictive pursuit, working memory, and sensory gating measures are more strongly associated with positive psychotic symptoms, while smooth pursuit initiation and processing speed measures are more strongly associated with primary negative symptoms. The relationships between clinical domains and other measures or clusters will be examined in an exploratory hypothesis-generating framework.|We propose to collect blood samples (or rarely saliva sample) from each participant to be stored for future association studies, as well as formal linkage analyses using phenotypes identified in specific aims 1 and 2.|We plan to examine how nicotine dependence may run in families and to examine if patterns of nicotine use may be related to a family history of schizophrenia. Participants will be asked about their smoking history and current smoking habits.

It is hoped that this information will give us clues about why so many individuals with schizophrenia smoke., Schizophrenia|Genetics|Eyetracking"
2	Phase 2 Trial of a Nicotinic Agonist in Schizophrenia, The objective of the trial is to determine if dosing 3-(2,4 dimethoxybenzylidene anabaseine) twice daily for 4 weeks will improve cognition and be safe. Secondary goals are to determine if these neurocognitive effects also have effects on neurobiological paradigms previously shown to be responsive to nicotinic receptor stimulation: suppression of P50 auditory evoked response, saccadic intrusions during smooth pursuit eye movements, and hemodynamic activity in the hippocampus during smooth pursuit eye movements as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging. The purpose of these neurobiological measures is to assess whether the response to 3-(2,4 dimethoxybenzylidene anabaseine) is consistent with activation of nicotinic receptors. In addition, the investigators will assess clinical response using a battery of clinical assessment scales and assessments of daily living functions. The purpose of these assessments is to address the FDA requirement of a clinical effect beyond change in laboratory neuropsychological performance. This study and the subsequent two studies will also include assessments of the safety of 3-(2,4 dimethoxybenzylidene anabaseine) and related compounds.||The purpose of the trial is to lay the groundwork for Phase III investigation. If this trial finds that 3-(2,4 dimethoxybenzylidene anabaseine) has effects at a safe dose, without tachyphylaxis, then the investigators intend to proceed to a Phase III trial, where the clinical importance of this effect can be measured.||The trial will be a double blind trial with placebo control. The order of doses and placebo will be randomized.||The Phase 1 study was completed in January, 2005, with 12 non-smoking schizophrenics subjects. The subjects were concurrently treated with neuroleptics throughout the study. They received 3 treatments, each for 1 day, in a double-blind crossover design. The treatments were 3-(2,4 dimethoxybenzylidene anabaseine) (150 mg + 75 mg 2 hours later), 3-(2,4 dimethoxybenzylidene anabaseine)(75 mg + 37.5 mg 2 hours later), and placebo. A significant effect on neurocognition, as measured by the Repeatable Battery for Assessment of Neuropsychological Status, and on sensory gating, as measured by P50 auditory evoked potentials was observed. Subjects reported no significant symptoms. One subject's white blood cell count decreased from just above normal limits on placebo to just below normal levels on 3-(2,4 dimethoxybenzylidene anabaseine)(150 + 75 mg 2 hours later). He did not receive further exposure to drug and his white blood cell count returned to normal at the next testing, 2 days later., Schizophrenia
2	The Efficacy and Safety of Risperidone in the Treatment of Adolescents With Schizophrenia, This is a clinical study of an investigational drug called risperidone in the treatment of schizophrenia in adolescents. Initially children (age 2 to 12 yrs) and schizophreniform subjects were also allowed but excluded following protocol amendment.||The study will include approximately 260 patients aged 13 to 17 years with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two groups on enrollment and will be given risperidone as an oral solution each day for 8 weeks at doses within one of two dose different ranges, according to the assigned study group.||Initially the two dose range were 0.15-0.4 mg/day and 1.5-4mg/day but were changed in protocol amendment to evaluate the maximum tolerated dose with a minimum of 3.5mg/day and maximum of 6mg/day (resp. 0.35 and 0.6mg/day in low dose treatment arm) Risperidone lower dose (0.35-0.6 mg/day [subjects >=50kg] or 0.007-0.012 mg/kg/day [subjects <50 kg]) as 0.1 mg/mL oral solution or risperidone higher dose (3.5-6 mg/day [subjects >=50 kg] or 0.07-0.12 mg/kg/day [subjects <50 kg]) as 1 mg/mL oral solution for 8 weeks.

2	Efficacy and Safety of a Long Acting Anti-Psychotic Versus Placebo in Patients With Schizophrenia, Many patients with schizophrenia have difficulty adhering to a daily oral treatment regimen. Long-acting injectable (LAI) formulations may provide therapeutic plasma concentrations over several weeks, thereby eliminating the need for daily oral medication and making compliance easier. This is a randomized (patients will be assigned to different treatment groups based solely on chance), double-blind (neither the patient nor the physician will know if placebo or drug is being given and at what dose), placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicenter, dose-response study in adults who have schizophrenia. The study consists of a screening period of no more than 7 days and a 13-week double-blind treatment period. The screening period includes 4 days for tolerability testing, if necessary. In the double-blind treatment period, patients will be randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups (3 fixed doses of paliperidone palmitate or placebo) to receive 4 i.m. injections of paliperidone palmitate or placebo on Days 1, 8, 36, and 64. The study, including the screening period, will last approximately 14 weeks. Efficacy will be assessed throughout the study using the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale for Schizophrenia (PANSS), the Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S), and the Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP). Safety will be evaluated throughout the study by monitoring adverse events, extrapyramidal symptom (EPS) rating scales scores, clinical laboratory test results; vital signs and body weight measurements; electrocardiograms (ECGs); and physical examination findings. In addition, the tolerability of injections will be assessed. ER OROS paliperidone 3 mg/day for 4 days.

1	Investigation of Neuroserpin as an Autism Candidate Gene, It is proposed to perform a pilot study to ask whether genetic variation at SERPINI1 is contributing to idiopathic autism. To maximize the chance of finding such variants, the perseveration and language delay endophenotypes (simpler intermediate traits) will be used to select twenty autistic multiplex (and if necessary singleplex) families with idiopathic autistic patients who have been evaluated with the Autism Diagnostic Interview-revised (ADI-R) and their nuclear families ( siblings and their parents) will be identified by Dr. Liptak and Dr. Lebel with the assistance of Ms Klausner and recruited. Patients with syndromic autism due to known causes such as fragile X syndrome, Tuberous sclerosis, Down syndrome, and Neurofibromatosis type I will be excluded. The entire SERPINI1 coding region (nine exons), one kilobase of promoter region (Chen, 2007) and at least 200 bp of intron flanking each exon will be sequenced in an index case and the segregation of mutations identified investigated within the families. All mutations that appear to be good functional candidates will be compared in frequency amongst autistic and control populations in order to determine if a case can be made that SERPINI1 could be contributing to autism. In addition, known neuroserpin SNPs identified through the Hapmap project (www.hapmap.org) will be investigated and tested for evidence of transmission distortion/disequilibrium by linkage/association analysis. Depending on the results from this initial experiment it is proposed to subsequently sequence up to a further 80 local autism patients (maximum of 100 patients). Additional studies would be performed as follow up studies to similarly sequence the genes of other serpins expressed in the brain; Plasminogen activator 1, PA1, SERPINE1 located at the MLS linkage peak at 7q22.1 seen in IMGSAC study (Lamb, 2002) while Proteinase nexin 1, PN1 SERPINE2 at 2q36.1,close to previously identified linkage peaks (Autism Genome Project consortium, 2007) and potentially their putative serine protease targets (tPA at 8p11.21 and uPA at 10q22.2) and the upstream neuroserpin activators (ALK6, AMH and BMP2) (Lebeurrier, 2008). tPA expression is increased by events that require synaptic plasticity (Yepes, 2002) and enhances NMDA receptor signaling by cleavage of its NR1 subunit (Pawlack, 2002). All interesting leads will be pursued by obtaining additional samples from the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE)( www.agre.org), a publically available recourse of phenotypic data and bio-materials which provides diagnostic information and DNA from 100's of multiplex ASD families., 0

0	A Study Comparing Two Treatments for Child With Anxiety, Anxiety disorders are among the most common psychiatric disorders in children and typically produce significant disruption in family, social, and academic functioning (Merikangas & Avenevoli, 2002). Fortunately, treatments for childhood anxiety have been manualized and found to be efficacious (Walkup, et al., 2008). These treatments most often incorporate aspects of cognitive-restructuring, relaxation training, and exposure to anxiety-producing stimuli. Unfortunately, many practitioners opt to utilize mainly cognitive and relaxation techniques at the expense of exposure techniques (Freiheit, Vye, Swan, & Cady, 2004). However, it remains unclear which of these components is most effective in reducing anxiety symptoms or the extent to which they act in concert; thus, the relative effectiveness of treatment for childhood anxiety when leaving-out a treatment component is unknown. The current study aims to compare the relative effectiveness of exposure therapy for childhood anxiety to cognitive restructuring and relaxation techniques. Sixty children and adolescents seeking treatment for anxiety in an outpatient pediatric anxiety clinic will be randomized to receive either six sessions of parent assisted exposure therapy or six sessions of individual cognitive restructuring and relaxation training. Comprehensive assessments will be completed by trained clinicians at pre-treatment and again at post-treatment to measure reductions in anxiety and related symptoms as well as improvements in daily functioning. We anticipate that children treated with exposure therapy will demonstrate significantly greater improvement over the six sessions than children treated with cognitive-restructuring and relaxation training, and will require fewer additional treatment sessions. Support of this hypthothesis would clarify the active ingredients in manualized treatment for childhood anxiety disorders and would potentially lead to quicker, more efficient treatment., child|anxiety|CBT

1	Improving Attention Skills of Children With Autism, Young children with autism show impairment in joint attention. The impairment affects their ability to sustain a shared interest in social interaction and to use specific joint attention skills, such as pointing and showing. The importance of joint attention is underscored by data suggesting these skills are important to later language skills. Targeting joint attention deficits in developmentally young children using familiar caregivers may result in better child language outcomes. This study will teach caregivers how to initiate and maintain episodes of joint engagement with their children.||Participants will be randomized to either the intervention group or to a wait list control group. Each caregiver and child in the intervention group will participate in 24 1-hour sessions, 3 times a week for 8 weeks. In these sessions, caregivers will be taught 10 different modules for teaching joint attention skills to their children. Outcome measures will include language and joint attention skills in the child and caregiver adherence to the intervention protocols. Children and caregivers will be assessed at baseline, during the course of the 8-week intervention, and 10 weeks after the end of the intervention.

2	European Long-acting Antipsychotics in Schizophrenia Trial, It remains unclear if depot medication can reduce relapse rates and improve clinical outcome when offered to all patients in need of continuation treatment with antipsychotics. Before we can conclude whether or not all schizophrenia patients could benefit from a switch to depot formulations, several questions remain to be answered. Is depot medication associated with better continuation rates and outcome? How are depot medications tolerated as compared to oral medication? In order to clarify these important issues we aim to perform a large multi-center trial in which schizophrenia patients in need of continuous treatment who are randomized 1:1:1:1 to two different depot preparations or to two different oral medications.||In this pragmatic, randomized, open label, multicenter, multinational comparative trial, schizophrenic patients aged 18 years or older, having experienced the first psychosis between 6 months and 7 years ago,with an indication (patient or physician initiated) to receive medication or to switch to another antipsychotic drug, will enter the study.||The study duration will be one month for the medication switch and then a follow-up of 18 months. Patients having refused to take part in the study will be asked to give consent and participate in a naturalistic follow-up, during which they will be followed with the Clinical Global Impression list (CGI) as closely related to the study schedule as possible, unless they also refuse this., depot, oral, antipsychotics, paliperidone, aripiprazole
2	A 2-year Study of Patients With Schizophrenia Who Are Treated With Long-acting Injectable Risperidone., Controlled clinical trials for treating schizophrenia often involve selected patients with common characteristics. It is recognized that schizophrenia are much more diverse than those in the clinical setting, and that physician's prescribing practices may vary. The objective of the study is to examine treatment practices for adult schizophrenic patients by their own physicians, and to assess patient outcomes when treated with long-acting risperidone injection. This is a 2-year, prospective, multi-center, longitudinal, observational study in adults with schizophrenia. Physicians will determine the appropriate treatment for their patients, according to their usual practice. Patients starting treatment with long-acting risperidone injections and meeting all the study criteria may enroll in the study. Patients will continue their treatment according to usual care by their physicians. Patients will be asked questions at baseline and every three months for a period of two years to assess: efficacy of the medication, how well the patient is functioning, use of healthcare resources (e.g., emergency room visits, hospitalizations) patient work status, quality of life and patient satisfaction with the medicine. Safety will be monitored throughout the study.

0	Modular Treatment for Preschool Anxiety, Early childhood mental illness is a growing public health concern, and can persist into adolescence and adulthood if left untreated. Anxiety disorders are among the most common psychiatric illnesses in preschool aged youth and place youth at significantly higher risk for anxiety, depression, substance abuse, conduct problems, and diminished academic/occupational and social/relational functioning later in life. Accordingly, there is increasing emphasis on early identification and intervention, before symptoms become entrenched to mitigate a trajectory towards longstanding impairment.||Unfortunately, empirically supported treatments for preschoolers with anxiety are limited. The few studies to date have tended to focus on relatively homogeneous samples whose symptoms resemble those in adults (e.g., worries and fears). Anxiety can present in similar ways to adult anxiety, however can also present more broadly in young children. Young children with anxiety may also present with extreme rigidity, sensory hypersensitivity, 'meltdowns'/emotional dysregulation/temper tantrums, ritualistic/routine oriented behavior, and oppositional behavior in some context. By focusing narrowly, treatments have not been adapted for the full range of anxiety presentations in early childhood.||Therefore, the proposed study evaluates a modular, parent-driven psychotherapy developed for preschool aged youth (3-7 years) with diagnostic levels of anxiety, as well as anxiety symptoms dimensionally. The treatment program, Parent-training Intervention for Preschoolers with Anxiety (PIPA), is based on empirically supported behavioral and parent-training principles as well as the investigators' recently published pilot study of preschoolers with obsessive compulsive disorder. Sixty youth will be treated during the study. PIPA focuses on exposure and response prevention therapy (E/RP) in the context of behavioral parent training, each of which have efficacy in youth with anxiety, including high functioning autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Certain parenting responses (e.g., overprotection, critical responding, accommodation of anxiety symptoms and avoidance) have been implicated in the etiology and maintenance of pediatric anxiety disorders and, in addition to E/RP, this intervention will target behavioral parent training and unhelpful parenting practices to support long-term outcomes.||In addition, this study will investigate one surrogate biomarker of anxiety in young children, fear conditioning (or more specifically, resistance to extinction). Behavioral treatment of anxiety, including the proposed PIPA intervention, relies on principles of extinction. Children and adults with anxiety disorders have been shown to have poorer fear extinction; however, there are few studies in young children examining this phenomenon. The potential to understand fear extinction in young children has implications for improving treatment efficacy and altering the negative trajectory of youth with anxiety disorders.||Eligibility will be determined at a baseline assessment. A second baseline assessment will occur one month later for those that qualify. This assessment will be used to control for symptom change due to the natural passage of time. Treatment will be delivered over 12 weeks and will include weekly 60-minute sessions. A brief phone call with an assessor each week will be used to track symptom change during treatment, and a post-treatment assessment will be conducted following the final treatment session, approximately 12 weeks later. Follow-up assessments will occur 1-month and 6-months following the final treatment session., modular|anxiety|preschool|exposure and response prevention|Cognitive behavioral therapy

2	Efficacy of Lu 31-130 in Patients With Schizophrenia, Schizophrenia is a serious and disabling mental disorder that affects approximately 1% of the world's population. Antipsychotic drugs remain the cornerstone in the pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia. However, none of the available drugs is ideal, in particular because of their complex safety profile and the limited effectiveness against certain symptom domains. Whereas positive symptoms respond to treatment the effects on negative symptoms and cognitive impairment are only very modest.||Thus present treatment options leave room for improvement and call for new, more effective pharmacotherapies for the treatment of schizophrenia. In the current study, patients suffering from schizophrenia and experiencing clinically significant symptoms of the disease will be included. Eligible patients will be randomised to blinded treatment with either flexible doses of Lu 31-130 or flexible doses of a standard antipsychotic treatment (olanzapine) for 12 weeks. The efficacy (including potential effects on cognitive symptoms) and the safety of Lu 31-130 will be explored in comparison to olanzapine., Schizophrenia|Antipsychotic|Olanzapine|Lu 31-130

2	"Can we Forget? Directed Forgetting and Embodied Cognition in Schizophrenia, Researchers used the directed forgetting paradigm composed of two lists of action verbs. The instruction ""to forget"" is given at the end of learning the first list (To Be Forgotten (TBF)), following a simulation of a computer bug. Therefore a second list is presented to be learned and remembered (To Be Remembered (TBR)). A recognition task is performed at the end. The action verbs had to be encoded using four conditions: action performed, mimed, imagined action, action with a contextual word, reading the action verb only. 48 schizophrenic patients were included in this study. Patients were randomized to have 10 participants per condition. 48 controls matched by age, gender, laterality and education are also included and randomized in the same modality. This study aims to show that the encoding of sensory-motor components, more than providing a context could improve the inhibitory capacities but also memory in schizophrenia, and possibly be used in remediation cognitive., Schizophrenia|Memory|Cognition"

2	Paired Associative Stimulation in the Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex in Patients With Schizophrenia, Neuroplasticity refers to changes in the strength of communication between different neurons. Long-term potentiation (LTP) is one form of neuroplasticity and refers to the strengthening of such communication. LTP is believed to be a cellular substrate of learning and memory. Paired associative stimulation (PAS) is a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) paradigm that is believed to induce LTP in human subjects. However, its effects have been shown to be minimal in patients with schizophrenia suggesting impaired LTP in schizophrenia. The lack of PAS effect in schizophrenia has been observed in the motor cortex (M1). Thus, the investigators propose to assess the effect of PAS in schizophrenia in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), an area of the brain that is especially relevant to learning and memory, and to the pathology in schizophrenia. The investigators also propose to assess the effect of PAS induced LTP on the performance of patients with schizophrenia on a cognitive task that is related to DLFPC.||Hypothesis 1: Patients with schizophrenia will have reduced PAS-LTP in DLPFC in comparison with healthy controls.||Hypothesis 2a: PAS-LTP in patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls randomized to PAS-25 and PAS-100 will correlate with performance on the N-back task at baseline (pre-PAS).||Hypothesis 2b: Healthy controls randomized to PAS-25 will perform better after one session of PAS-25 on the 1- and 7-day N-back task compared to healthy controls randomized to PAS-100.||Hypothesis 2c: Among healthy controls randomized to PAS-25, the magnitude of improvement on the 1- and 7-day N-back task (compared to pre-PAS) that is in excess of the magnitude of improvement on the 1- and 7-day N-back task among subjects randomized to PAS-100 will correlate with the degree of PAS-LTP.||Hypothesis 3a: Patients with schizophrenia who are randomized to receive a 2-week course of PAS-25 will have improved PAS-LTP in DLPFC compared to patients with schizophrenia randomized to 2-week course of PAS-100.||Hypothesis 3b: Patients with schizophrenia who are randomized to receive a 2-week course of PAS-25 will have improved performance on the N-back working memory task compared to patients with schizophrenia randomized to 2-week PAS-100 at 1- and 7-day post-PAS course N-back.||Hypothesis 3c: Patients with schizophrenia who are randomized to receive a 2-week course of PAS-25 will have increased DLPFC cortical thickness compared to patients with schizophrenia randomized to 2-week PAS-100.||Hypothesis 4: Among patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls, PAS-LTP will decrease with age, and the decrease will be more pronounced in healthy controls than in patients., Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)|Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC)|Schizophrenia|Working Memory|Paired Associative Stimulation (PAS)|Electroencephalography (EEG)|Cognition

2	Online Family Support and Education for Schizophrenia, Although psychoeducational programs for schizophrenia can reduce patient relapse rates and reduce family distress, participation rates are often low. This study evaluated an online model to provide the families of schizophrenia patients with knowledge of illness management to reduce family burden and increase perceived social support.||Relatives of patients with schizophrenia who received 12 months of customary care with access to the educational website for the first year were compared to matched group of relatives of individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia who were receiving customary care and who consented to participate in a family education program. In the education condition, relatives were provided with private, secure access to the website, which features family-to-family chat capabilities, video lectures on the management of schizophrenia, written materials on important issues in schizophrenia management, professionally facilitated online discussions of the material, and additional resource links.||Relatives were assessed using 90-minute interviews at the beginning of the project and every 6 months for 12 months. The interviews were used to assess the family member's perception of the patient's symptoms, his or her knowledge of the illness, the illness's impact on the family member, and his or her perception of the website intervention.||Patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were also asked to complete interviews and assessments at the beginning of the project and every 6 months for 12 months. The assessments include questions about symptoms, medication compliance and side effects, hospitalizations, and social functioning.||The major hypotheses were that relative participation in the online program would be associated with lower symptoms rates and hospitalizations in the patients., Schizophrenia|Family|Psychoeducation|Internet

2	Nicotine Effects on Endophenotypes of Schizophrenia, Convergent findings suggest that an altered neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor system may contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Nicotine consumption through cigarette smoking might represent a form of self-medication in schizophrenia as nicotine reduces cognitive and physiological deficits in schizophrenia. The present study aims to investigate how nicotine affects attentional and executive schizophrenia endophenotypes and how genetic polymorphisms relating to the cholinergic system might play a role in inter-individual differences in the magnitude of nicotine effects.||Schizophrenia patients, first-degree relatives of schizophrenia patients as well as healthy controls will receive transdermal nicotine in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study and will be assessed with prepulse inhibition, antisaccades, the continuous performance test, spatial working memory and a verbal memory task. Subjects will be overnight-abstinent smokers and non-smokers. However, the investigators will particularly test non-smokers in order to eliminate confounding effects of nicotine withdrawal and reinstatement.||Main hypotheses:||Schizophrenia patients will perform worse than matched controls in all cognitive tests (validating our endophenotypes).|Nicotine administration will enhance cognitive performance in overnight-abstinent smokers.|Improvement of cognitive performance in smokers with schizophrenia will be stronger than in control smokers.|Improvement of cognitive performance in smoking first-degree relatives of schizophrenia patients will be stronger than in control smokers.|Nicotine administration will affect cognitive functioning in non-smoking subjects.|Nicotine administration will improve cognitive functioning in non-smoking schizophrenia patients.|The effects of nicotine in non-smoking subjects are stronger in those subjects who are cognitively more impaired (i.e. performing below the median of the respective group).||The present research contributes to the issue whether nicotinic cholinergic receptor agonists may have therapeutic value in the treatment of cognition in schizophrenia., nicotine|schizophrenia|endophenotype

The health technology to be assessed is the augmentation of clozapine treatment with another second-generation antipsychotic, amisulpride, which will be compared with placebo: 400mg amisulpride or 1 matching placebo capsule for the first 4 weeks, then the option of titrating up to 800mg amisulpride or 2 matching placebo capsules for the remaining 8 weeks. The study will be double-blind, with medication supplied as identical capsules containing either 400mg amisulpride or placebo. The optimum dose of clozapine at entry and subsequent augmentation will be achieved through a flexible dosing regimen whereby treating psychiatrists will be able to flexibly alter dose regimens to maximise clinical risk-benefit ratios; there will be opportunities for clinical titration of clozapine dose at two and six weeks. Any direct pharmacokinetic effect on clozapine levels will be assessed by pre- and post-augmentation plasma levels of clozapine, samples being taken at baseline and at the end of the 12 weeks. Recommended pharmacovigilance procedures will be followed. Clinicians will be asked not to prescribe any additional medication during the course of the study, and will be reminded of the drugs with potential adverse interactions, as mentioned in the SPCs for clozapine and amisulpride. Medication adherence will be assessed by 'pill count' and clozapine/norclozapine plasma level ratio.||Therapeutic improvement will be assessed in terms of overall symptom severity, but also using broader, clinically-relevant outcome measures of social and occupational function and target symptoms and/or behaviours as well as overall health status and utility. Side effects will be systematically assessed. The costs and outcomes for a cost effectiveness acceptability and net benefit analysis will also be measured. The primary economic measure will be the incremental cost effectiveness ratio of clozapine augmentation, estimated as the net cost of clozapine augmentation divided by net QALY of clozapine augmentation.||Twenty-four months will be allowed for recruitment of participants, plus 3 months for the final follow-up assessments., 0
2	"A Study to Evaluate Participants Satisfaction, Quality of Life and Effectiveness of Flexible-Dose of Paliperidone Extended Release (ER) in Participants With Schizophrenia, Previously Treated With Risperidone, This is an open-label (a medical research study in which participants and researchers are told which treatments the participants are receiving, ""unblinded""), multi-center (when more than 1 hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study), non-randomized, single-arm study of paliperidone ER in participants previously treated with risperidone with poor response. The study will consist of 2 phases: a main phase of 6 months and an extension phase of another 6 months. The total duration of the study will be 12 months. All participants will receive an oral (having to do with the mouth) daily dose of paliperidone ER in flexible dosage (in the range of 3-12 milligram [mg]: 3 mg, 6 mg, 9 mg, or 12 mg) according to Investigator's discretion. Efficacy and safety of participants will primarily be evaluated by Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and Extrapyramidal Symptoms Rating Scale (ESRS), respectively. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study., Schizophrenia|Paliperidone"
2	28-30 Month Study Comparing Paliperidone Palmitate With Oral Risperidone for Treating Adults Diagnosed With Schizophrenia Within the Past 5 Years, This is a Prospective, Randomized, Active-controlled, Rater-blinded Study to to assess the efficacy of paliperidone palmitate compared with oral risperidone in delaying time to relapse in patients recently diagnosed with schizophrenia who are at high risk of relapse. Recently diagnosed is defined as first diagnosis of any psychotic disorder within 5 years prior to screening. High risk of relapse is defined as having documented occurrence of 3 periods of breakthrough symptoms that required a change in patient care per the investigator's judgment (e.g., increase in dose, addition of a new drug, increase in the level of psychiatric care, notable increases in the frequency or intensity of patient contact required to maintain outpatient status, psychiatric hospitalization, etc.) within the previous 24 months, including 1 such period within the previous 6 months. Safety evaluations will include Adverse Event (AE) reporting, hematology and clinical chemistry laboratory tests, vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG), and evaluations of suicidality and sexual functioning. Patients will receive either paliperidone palmitate 50, 75, 100, or 150 mg eq. monthly by injection for two years or oral risperidone 2, 4, 6, or 8 mg tabs once daily for two years., Schizophrenia|Risperidone|Risperdal|Paliperidone Palmitate|Invega Sustenna
2	Evaluation of a Cognitive Adaptive E-treatment in Schizophrenia-diagnosed Adults, The symptoms of schizophrenia fall into three main categories: positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and cognitive symptoms. Each category represents distinct functional challenges and impedes patient productivity and overall quality of life.||Cognitive symptoms are pervasive and result in deficits in executive functioning (the ability to understand information and use it to make decisions), attention (the ability to identify, select, and focus on relevant sensory events), and working memory (the ability to hold information in memory and then guide actions from it). These symptoms impair patients' abilities to successfully perform everyday activities, including independent living, employment, and social relationships, and in addition can cause great emotional distress.||Cognitive impairment in schizophrenia has now received substantial academic study, with over 24,000 research papers published in the field since 1990. This enormous body of work has shown that cognitive impairment is likely to be present in virtually all patients with schizophrenia, regardless of their severity of illness or treatment status. People with schizophrenia typically perform 1-2 standard deviations below the mean of age-matched controls (indicating substantial impairment) across the domains of speed of information processing, attention, working memory, verbal and visual learning, reasoning and social cognition.||While cognitive impairment in schizophrenia was originally assumed to be secondary to positive or negative symptoms of the disorder, or related to the use of anti-psychotic medications, recent research has conclusively shown that neither of these past assumptions is true. For example, the landmark Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) trial involving 1,493 participants demonstrated that negative symptoms are only mildly correlated with cognitive function, and that positive symptoms are completely uncorrelated with cognitive function. Furthermore, research has shown that cognitive impairment is evident in people with schizophrenia before they are medicated, prior to diagnosis, and in first-degree relatives of people diagnosed with schizophrenia; indicating that medication is not the cause of cognitive impairment. In aggregate, these data have established the well-accepted current viewpoint that cognitive dysfunction is a core primary symptom and deficit in schizophrenia., Schizophrenia|Cognitive deficits|Cognitive remediation|Software|Brain Plasticity

2	EEG and Behavioral Correlates of Temporal Prediction in the Tactile Modality in Schizophrenia, Patients with schizophrenia have disturbances in their sense of self, particularly their bodily self. Disorders of the sense of self are central to schizophrenia and are of interest because they are thought to be present prior to the development of the disorder, when only a few attenuated symptoms signal a risk of developing psychosis. Finding markers related to the sense of self would make it possible to predict which subjects, among those with minimal psychotic symptoms, will develop psychosis, and thus to better adapt management. Disturbances in the experience of the passage of time that accompany disturbances in the sense of self have been described particularly in subjects at risk of developing psychosis, and would predict the onset of the pathology. However, as with alterations in the sense of self, it can be difficult to get patients to describe their disturbances in the experience of time, and objective measures are required to facilitate detection of these disturbances. In the present protocol an objective measure of temporal perception mechanisms will be tested in relation to the sense of self.||The tests used in the protocol assess subjects' abilities to benefit from the passage of time and to use these abilities to predict and prepare for the occurrence of an event. The investigators have previously shown that patients with impaired bodily sense of self do not benefit from the passage of time to prepare themselves to process information in the future. The present protocol is aimed at developing a measure more sensitive to the patients' disorders by adding tactile measures., 0

2	Schizophrenia Sensory Gating Deficit With Quetiapine, .Problems with attention and perception are core features of schizophrenia and are hypothesized to result from defects in the filtering or gating of sensory input. Examination of this requires neuoimaging techniques with high temporal resolution. High-density EEG and MEG in combination with structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) are used to map sensory gating. In a number of recent studies patient treated with novel antipsychotics have been shown to have P50 gating ratios resembling those of normal controls rather than that of schizophrenia subjects treatment with conventional antipsychotics. To date, there is no literature on the effects of quetiapine on sensory gating. Subjects who meet all inclusion criteria and have been on a stable dose of quetiapine for three months will receive a clinical interview, an MRI, MEG, and neuropsychological testing to determine if patients with schizophrenia who are treated with quetiapine will demonstrate a sensory gating ratio similar to normal controls, indicating no deficit in sensory gating., Psychiatry|Antipsychotic|Psychopharmacology|Clinical Trial|Open Label|Schizophrenia|Sensory Gating|Attention|Memory

2	Mitochondria and Schizophrenia: Effects of Antipsychotic Drugs, In past study, we had shown that there were significant differences in serum Lpo (lipid peroxidation) and Thiol levels between patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls. For patients taking risperidone, there were significant decreases in serum Thiol levels. In addition, there were also significant differences in age of onset of PPAR gamma coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) polymorphism for schizophrenia patients. Therefore, we want to know the relationships between oxidative stress-, apoptosis-related markers, mitochondria DNA copy numbers and the clinical psychopathology of schizophrenia, including severity of positive and negative symptoms, obesity and metabolic syndrome.||In past study, we also found that there were significant differences in 10 SNPs located in the D-loop region-related genes between patients and healthy controls. Three SNPs could be found in Mitomap data, but another seven SNPs not been found in the Mitomap and they could be more confirmed. In addition, Tanaka et al. found that haplogroup N9a was related to diabetes and metabolic syndrome in Asia. Therefore, we were interested to clarify the relationships between above related mitochondria genes and clinical phenotypes in Taiwanese populations,.||In addition, we also want to see whether these biological markers could be as clinical markers in schizophrenia for a long-term follow-up study., Schizophrenia|Oxidative stress|Mitochondria

2	Impact of Inflammation on Reward Circuits, Motivational Deficits and Negative Symptoms in Schizophrenia, Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness that affects 1% of the population, but accounts for over $60 billion in costs to the national healthcare system. Negative symptoms of schizophrenia, including motivational deficits, are some of the most debilitating aspects of the disorder, being both difficult to treat and representing one of the most significant barriers to functional recovery. One pathophysiologic pathway that may contribute to these alterations in reward circuitry in schizophrenia is inflammation. Increased inflammation has been reliably linked to deficits in reward processing and decreased motivation via effects of inflammatory cytokines on regions of the basal ganglia, including the ventral striatum. Previous findings show that some patients with schizophrenia reliably exhibit elevated concentrations of inflammatory markers and that inflammatory cytokines may be related to negative symptoms including decreased motivation. Relevant to the impact of inflammation on insulin signaling, measures of insulin sensitivity are significantly worse in patients with schizophrenia, including at illness onset. Moreover, antipsychotic medications lead to metabolic syndrome, contributing to risk for insulin resistance and ultimately diabetes. Insulin resistance is believed to be caused by increased inflammation, and in turn can contribute to inflammation through alterations in glucose metabolism.||This study uses an oral glucose tolerance test to test the hypothesis that insulin resistance drives inflammation. The researchers will recruit subjects with a range of insulin resistance, as measured by the Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR). This will allow the researchers to investigate the contributions of metabolic dysfunction and inflammation on inflammatory and metabolic markers, brain reward circuitry, motivational deficits, and negative symptoms., Inflammation|Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)|Negative Symptoms
2	Clinical Trial of Tolcapone for Cognition in Schizophrenia, Psychopharmacological modulation of the catecholaminergic system can enhance some aspects of cognitive function. For example, COMT inhibitors can slightly improve working memory/executive function. Differences in the response between individuals might be related to a number of factors, including variations in the genes. The recent finding that a polymorphism in the catechol-o-methyl-transferase (COMT) gene, which produces a 4 fold change in enzyme activity, accounts for 4 percent of the variance in performance of working memory tasks in humans suggest that COMT genotype may predict response to COMT inhibitors. In the present investigation our goal is to examine, in normal controls and patients with schizophrenia, the effect of a centrally acting (tolcapone) and of a peripherally acting (entacapone) COMT inhibitor on cognitive function. We predict that both normal controls and patients with schizophrenia with the val/val genotype will have a significant, though transient, improvement in working memory in subjects treated with tolcapone but not in those treated with entacapone. Furthermore, in conjunction with other NIMH imaging protocols, we would like to examine the neurophysiological correlates related to working memory. We predict, in tolcapone treated subjects, improved measures in prefrontal 'efficiency' in subjects and patients specifically with the val/val genotype. The present protocol will provide new insights on the importance of this genetic polymorphism in the regulation of aminergic-controlled cognitive function in normal individuals. Furthermore, this protocol will test whether COMT inhibitors offer a new treatment-based on genotype - for cognitive impairment in schizophrenia.

2	Study on Metabolic Parameters of Sertindole in Patients With Schizophrenia, The prevalence of metabolic syndrome is estimated to be around 20-25% of the population and is particularly high in patients with schizophrenia. Individuals with metabolic syndrome are twice as likely to die from, and three times as likely to suffer from a heart attack or stroke compared to individuals without the syndrome.||Patients on atypical antipsychotic medication should be considered a high risk group for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Weight gain is common in patients taking neuroleptics and atypical antipsychotics, and excessive body weight is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes., Schizophrenia
2	Trial of Treatment for Internalized Stigma in Schizophrenia, Internalized (or self) stigma develops when people with mental illness become aware of stigmatizing attitudes held by many in society about mental illness (e.g., dangerousness, incompetence, inability to work), perceive these attitudes as being legitimate, and apply them to themselves. There is substantial evidence that internalized stigma is strongly negatively linked to both the objective (e.g., social functioning) and subjective (e.g., self-esteem and well-being) components of recovery for persons with schizophrenia, and that these effects operate independent of symptom-related disability. Nevertheless, few efforts have been made to develop treatment to address this issue. Previously, the investigators were funded to develop a group-based intervention (R34MH082161) combining cognitive-behavioral therapy and narrative psychotherapy to address internalized stigma among people with severe mental illness. The purpose of the present study is to build upon the investigators' previous exploratory intervention development study by conducting an adequately-powered, randomized controlled trial of the Narrative Enhancement/Cognitive Therapy (NECT) intervention among persons with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. The investigators will screen 500 persons at two sites (Newark, New Jersey and Indianapolis, IN) for evidence of moderate or elevated internalized stigma. They will conduct a randomized study of NECT versus supportive group therapy in a sample of 175 individuals meeting Structured Clinical Interview criteria for schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. Randomization will be stratified by baseline self-stigma severity (moderate or elevated), to ensure roughly equal numbers of participants for each stratum. Participants will complete baseline, post-treatment, 3-month post treatment and 6-month post treatment assessments of internalized stigma, psychiatric symptoms, insight, self-esteem, hopelessness, coping, narrative coherence and social functioning. The specific aims of the project are: 1) Conduct a randomized study of the effectiveness of NECT, comparing outcomes for 175 persons with schizophrenia-spectrum disorder randomly assigned to NECT or supportive group therapy, 2) Examine the mediating impact of changes in narrative coherence and in the use of problem-centered coping strategies on outcomes for persons assigned to the NECT treatment. The intervention can have important implications for enhancing usual care services to reduce disability for people with schizophrenia, and therefore has potentially important implications for improving the public health., 0
1	Parents of Newly Diagnosed Preschool Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder:, Statement of the Research Problem/Purpose/Objectives Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurological disorder that causes complex developmental difficulties within the first three years of life. Preschool children diagnosed with ASD typically have pervasive deficits in social interaction and communication, and the occurrence of repetitive and restrictive behaviours. Parenting a preschool child with these characteristics, coupled with the devastating impact of their child receiving a diagnosis of ASD, creates high levels of parental anxiety, stress, depression, and general mental health difficulties. Given the seriousness of the child's diagnosis and the compromise in parenting and family functioning, families are referred to formalized treatment programs that provide support for both the child and parents. However, with the recent rise in Autism prevalence rates Manitoba parents now wait up to a year to receive formalized government funded treatment services for their child and family. This delay in formalized service has critically important consequences for the child, the family, and society.||To bridge this gap in service, parents could be afforded the opportunity to participate in a cost efficient self-directed online training and support program specific to parents in Manitoba. Given that there is consistent evidence to support the effectiveness of parent training and involvement once a child has entered a formalized treatment program, the potential effectiveness of parent training and support while waiting for a formalized treatment program should also be considered.||Research on the efficacy and effectiveness of on-line self-directed Autism parent training programs is extremely limited. Additionally, there is a lack of knowledge regarding the appropriate content, timing, and duration of a training program for parents of newly diagnosed children with ASD and conflicting evidence on the interactional effects between parent training and levels of parenting stress during this time period.||The primary purpose of this study is to address the training and support requirements of parents of preschool children newly diagnosed with ASD, by developing and evaluating the effectiveness of a self-directed on-line ASD parent training and support program. The secondary purpose is to assess the interactional effects, of a self-directed on-line ASD parent training and support program, and parent stress, on parent and child outcomes. It is predicted that if parents receive on-line training and support they will increase their parenting knowledge and skills, reduce their levels of stress, and create better engagement and communication outcomes for their child, in comparison to parents who do not receive the training and support.||Methods: The experimental study will use a randomized, masked, waitlist control design that compares an intervention treatment group to a waitlist control group. After meeting criteria and consent requirements for participation in the study, all families will participate in pre-measures. Families will then be randomized to either a treatment group or a waitlist control group. After pre measures the treatment group parents will receive access to the on-line self-directed training and support program for a 4-month period. After this time period both groups will then be re-assessed on the Parent and Child outcome measures and then the Waitlist Group will be given access to the on-line self-directed training and support program.||Procedure. After a family has been assessed as eligible for the study, and have signed consent forms to participate in the study, they will be given an appointment time to attend the nursery setting for pre-measures. One parent will be asked to engage in free play with their child similar to how they would at home (using a standardized set of toys). The parent will be video recorded playing with their child for a ten-minute period, and then asked to answer the three questionnaires. This procedure will occur at baseline (Time 1, within 2 months of diagnosis), and after the treatment period (Time 2, at least four months after the baseline measure). After base-line measures, families will be randomly assigned to the treatment group, and the waitlist group, using a random numbers table and a pre-arranged opaque envelope system. Treatment group parents will then be given access to participate in the on-line self-directed parent training and support intervention between Time 1 and Time 2, and the waitlist group parents will be given access to the intervention after Time 2. Parents will be given codes to access the on-line resources to ensure their anonymity to other participants. The codes will also allow the principle investigator to track when parents access the on-line training and support and when they have completed the on-line training. When treatment group parents have completed the on-line training (and after at least a four-month period has elapsed since the baseline measure) the parent and child will be invited back to the nursery setting for Time 2 measurements.||Additionally, after a four-month period the matched waitlist group parent and child will be invited back to the original setting for Time 2 measurements, after which they will be given access to the on-line training and support. Families that signed consent forms and then dropped out, will also be given access to the on-line training and support, at this time. The personnel used to administer, score and input the data for the questionnaires, and observational measures, will be masked as to the participant's group assignment and time of measure. All data will contain only the code with no specific participant identifiers. All digital video recordings, questionnaires, observations sheets, and participant code sheets will be kept in a locked cabinet in the office of the main investigator and on a password protected secured government server. Inter-observer agreement will be used in the observation measures of the parent's intervention techniques and the child's measures of engagement and communication. For these observational measures, personnel will be trained by the primary investigator. Inter-observer agreement will be used in a training procedure until personnel meet or exceed 80% agreement on each measure for two consecutive observation trials. Additionally, after all observation data has been collected, a random sample of 20% of the data for each measure will be scored by two personnel, and inter-observer agreement will be reported.||The independent variable is the on-line self-directed parent training and support program. Each on-line module contains multi-media presentations (written material, graphics, and video's), links to additional materials found on the internet, summaries of key information, small quizzes that help parents focus on important material and an accompanying parent workbook. In addition, parents are directed in Module 2 to an on-line parenting support and information sharing forum exclusive to the parents in the training program. Through the on-line forum parents can access a professional autism specialist and other parents involved in the study, and are able to ask questions, answer questions, provide comments, discuss issues, and in general receive support and give support to others.||Four specific hypotheses will be tested for statistical significance. The first hypothesis is: Parents in the treatment group will have significantly higher Family Support, Knowledge and Intervention Techniques scores, and significantly lower Stress scores at Time 2, compared to the control group. This hypothesis will be tested individually for each measure using an Analysis of Covariance design (ANCOVA) to test for differences between groups while adjusting for any initial difference.||The second hypothesis is: Children of parents in the treatment group will have significantly higher scores in Engagement and Communication at Time 2 compared to children of parents in the control group. This hypothesis will be tested individually for each measure using an Analysis of Covariance design (ANCOVA) to test for differences between groups while adjusting for any initial difference.||The third hypothesis is: Parent's perceived level of stress will moderate the treatment effects on Parent outcomes measures of Knowledge and Intervention Techniques at Time 2. Specifically, it is hypothesized that there will be a negative (inverse) correlation between Parent stress scores at Time 1 and Parent Knowledge and Intervention Technique scores at time 2 (the higher the parent's stress score at Time 1, the lower the parent's Knowledge and Intervention Technique scores at Time 2). Additionally, it is hypothesized that there will be a negative (inverse) correlation between the parent's change in stress scores from Time 1 to Time 2 to parent's Knowledge and Intervention Technique scores at Time 2 (as parents perceived level of stress decreases from Time 1 to Time 2 parent's Knowledge and Intervention Technique scores will increase at Time 2). Correlations will be conducted using Pearson's product-moment (r) calculations.||The fourth hypothesis is: Parent's perceived level of stress will moderate the treatment effects on Child outcomes measures of Engagement and Communication at Time 2. Specifically, it is hypothesized that there will be a negative (inverse) correlation between Parent stress scores at Time 1 and Child Engagement and Communication scores at time 2 (the higher the parent's stress score at Time 1, the lower the Child Engagement and Communication scores at Time 2). Additionally, it is hypothesized that there will be a negative (inverse) correlation between the parent's change in stress scores from Time 1 to Time 2 to the Child's Engagement and Communication scores at Time 2 (as parents perceived level of stress decreases from Time 1 to Time 2 the Child's Engagement and Communication scores will increase at Time 2). Correlations will be conducted using Pearson's product-moment (r) calculations.||Process for Seeking Consent Initial screening for patients that meet the criteria will be done by the Developmental Pediatricians at the Child Development Clinic. When patients are in the SSCY Centre for a counsel with their Pediatrician, the Pediatrician will provide the families of all those who meet the inclusion criteria with a study advertisement containing the PIs contact information. Parents who phone the Principal Investigator to find out more about their participation in the study will be given the option of meeting the Principal Investigator at an office in the SSCY Centre or at their home, or at a place of their choosing. The Principal Investigator will explain the study and the consent form at that time. Parents will be told that they do not need to decide immediately and that they have the option of reviewing the study documentation and consent forms with others, and at their convenience. They will also be given a phone number to call if they have any further questions., Parenting|Training|Support|On-line|Stress
2	Comparison of Paliperidone Palmitate and RISPERDAL CONSTA in Patients With Schizophrenia, This is a randomized (patients assigned to treatment groups by chance), double-blind (patient and study staff will not know the treatment assignment) study of paliperidone palmitate compared with RISPERDAL CONSTA (Risperidone Long-Acting Intramuscular Injection) in adult patients with schizophrenia. The total duration of the study will be approximately 14 weeks. For those patients without source documentation of tolerability to oral (by mouth) risperidone or paliperidone Extended Release (ER) tablets, injectable RISPERDAL CONSTA or paliperidone palmitate, or those patients who were not currently taking another antipsychotic, a minimum of 4 days and a maximum of 6 days of oral paliperidone ER treatment at a dosage of 6 mg/day will be administered for tolerability testing before the first injection of double-blind (DB) study drug (paliperidone palmitate or RISPERDAL CONSTA). During the DB period, study drug will be administered to patients as an intramuscular (i.m.) injection. Paliperidone palmitate (PP) 150mg equivalent (eq) (and RISPERDAL CONSTA placebo) at Baseline (BL) (Day 1), 100mg eq at Visit (V) 4 (Day 8), 50 or 100mg eq at V7 (Day 36), and 50,100,or 150mg eq at V9 (Day 64) or RISPERDAL CONSTA (RC) 25mg at V4 and V6 (Day 22), 25 or 37.5mg at V7, and 25, 37.5, or 50mg at V9 will be given as i.m. injections.

2	Long-acting Injectable Risperidone in Patients With Schizophrenia After an Acute Episode, Although many schizophrenia patients currently take oral antipsychotic medications, it is estimated that up to 75% of them have difficulty adhering to the daily oral regiment. Long-acting injectable formulations may eliminate the need for daily medication and enhance patient compliance with the treatment regimen. Traditionally, patients experiencing an episode of schizophrenia are first treated with oral medications until they are stabilized, and then injectable long-acting formulations are given. This is an open, multicenter, randomized Phase IV trial in patients after an acute episode of schizophrenia. Patients will be in the trial for 6 months. One treatment group will receive injections starting at baseline (early initiation); the other group will start with treatment as usual at baseline and begin injections at Week 12 (late initiation). Assessment of effectiveness include Positive And Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), in order to measure symptoms of schizophrenia; Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S), measuring overall severity of illness; Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF), assessesing overall psychological, social, and occupational functioning; and Quality of Life Questionnaire SF-12, measuring overall health status. Safety evaluations include the Extrapyramidal Symptoms Rating Scale (ESRS), incidence of adverse events throughout the study, and vital signs (pulse, blood pressure). The study hypothesis is that early initiation of long-acting risperidone injections is not inferior to late initiation as measured by changes in PANSS total score from baseline through endpoint (after 6 months). Risperidone, long-acting formulation for intramuscular injections (25 to 50 mg (maximum)), given every 14 days through 6 months, starting at baseline or Month 3.

0	Project H-COVID: Evaluating Hyper-Brief, Online Materials During the COVID-19 Pandemic, Elevations in state anxiety, when moderate and temporary, serve an adaptive function in pandemic contexts, facilitating health behaviors like self-protection and social distancing. However, for some people elevated state anxiety transitions to anxiety disorders, creating undue suffering and impairment. Nearly 33% of both Wuhan residents and Chinese citizens screened positive for generalized anxiety disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic, with uncontrollable, persistent COVID-19-related worries strongly predicting presence of GAD. Similarly, large surveys indicate that levels of anxiety symptoms are rising among United States citizens.||This finding aligns with a large body of literature indicating stronger perceived control over one's own anxiety buffers against a variety of anxiety disorders. Thus, in the context of COVID-19, there is a pressing need for materials that might strengthen perceived control over anxiety, thereby reducing risk for anxiety disorder onset. Ideally, such materials would (1) in no way undermine positive health behaviors, like social distancing, and (2) have capacity for broad-scale, immediate accessibility. Internet-based interventions may particularly valuable during the pandemic stage of COVID-19 due to the need for social distancing, and they have already scaled up to address needs in China. However, drop out from internet-based interventions can be up to 83% and intervention engagement is a frequent issue. Fortunately, single-session experiences (SSEs) can improve mental health related outcomes with similar effect sizes as multi-session therapies, and pilot data from our team suggests they can increase general perceived control (within-group dz = 0.70).||The goal of this project is to test a web-based platform where people can confidentially access and provide feedback on brief activities, called 'single-session experiences' (SSEs), which are about 8 minutes in length, entirely self-administered, and computer-based (Contain COVID Anxiety and Project Remain COVID Free). Previous activities following the same best practices as these experiences have been shown to be safe to complete; predicted significant reductions in psychological distress; and are entirely self-administered. We will recruit a weighted-probability sample of the United States through Prolific's online platform, N = 500. All data collected from the SSEs will be confidential, and the only identifiable information that will be recorded is the participants' Prolific ID to facilitate compensation, which will be deleted from the data after the compensation has been paid. Those that choose to complete the activities have the option to submit their advice to their peers and have it posted anonymously to the web-based platform. This will provide people with an option for an easily accessible activity designed to promote healthy coping skills and resilience in a welcoming environment through which they can learn with others and share experiences., 0

2	A Study of Risperidone Long-Acting Injection Versus Oral Antipsychotics in Schizophrenia Participants With a History of Being Poorly Compliant With Taking Their Medication, This is a Phase 4, an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), multi-country and multi-centric (conducted in more than one center) study of risperidone long-acting formulation versus oral (having to do with the mouth) atypical antipsychotics in participants with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition Text revision ( DSM-IV TR) diagnosis of schizophrenia currently being treated with oral antipsychotic medication. The duration of this study will be 2 years. All the eligible participants will be randomly assigned to an oral atypical antipsychotic (risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, and where commercially available, aripiprazole and amisulpride) or to risperidone long-acting formulation. For risperidone long-acting formulation participants, study medication will be administered by intramuscular (into the muscle) injection every 2 weeks at doses of 25, 37.5 or 50 milligram (mg). Oral supplementation with the current oral atypical antipsychotic is required for the first 3 weeks following the initial injection and dose increase. Dose increase can be made as per product labeling. The primary measure of effectiveness is the reduction in the percentage of participants experiencing a clinical exacerbation after being in the study for 3 months. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study., Schizophrenia|Risperidone|Risperdal Consta
2	Effectiveness and Safety of 3 Fixed Doses (25 mg eq., 100 mg eq., and 150 mg eq.) of Paliperidone Palmitate in Patients With Schizophrenia, The primary hypothesis is that, after an initial 150 mg eq. loading dose in the deltoid muscle followed by either deltoid or gluteal injections in patients with schizophrenia, paliperidone palmitate (25, 100, or 150 mg eq.) is superior to placebo as measured by the change in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale for Schizophrenia (PANSS) total score over a 13-week period.This is a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicenter, dose-response study of men and women who have a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) diagnosis of schizophrenia. The secondary objectives are to: Assess the benefits in personal and social functioning (key secondary endpoint) associated with the use of paliperidone palmitate compared with placebo, Assess the global improvement in severity of illness associated with the use of paliperidone palmitate compared with placebo, Assess the dose-response and exposure-response relationship of paliperidone palmitate The study includes a screening period of up to 7 days and a 13 week double-blind treatment period. The screening period includes washout of disallowed psychotropic medications. Subjects without source documentation of previous exposure to at least 2 doses of oral risperidone, or paliperidone ER, or one dose of i.m. RISPERDAL CONSTA, or paliperidone palmitate will be given 4 to 6 days of paliperidone ER 6 mg/day for tolerability testing. Patients who have source documentation of previous exposure to the above medications and are currently taking another antipsychotic regimen will continue their current treatment through Day -1. At the beginning of the double-blind treatment period, subjects will be randomly assigned in equal numbers to 1 of 4 treatment groups (an initial loading dose of 150 mg eq. of paliperidone palmitate given by deltoid injection followed by 3 fixed i.m. doses of paliperidone palmitate [25, 100, or 150 mg eq.] on Days 8, 36, and 64 or placebo given in the same manner). Note: The choice of the injection site (deltoid or gluteal) for all remaining injections after the initial loading dose will be at the discretion of the investigator. The entire study, including the screening period, will last approximately 14 weeks.Samples for pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation will be collected at designated time points. Effectiveness and safety will be evaluated periodically throughout the study. A pharmacogenomic blood sample (10 mL) will be collected from patients who give separate written informed consent for this part of the study (where local regulations permit). This will allow for pharmacogenomic research, as necessary. Participation in pharmacogenomic research is optional. Approximately 105 to 115 mL of whole blood will be collected during the study. Patients randomly assigned to paliperidone palmitate will receive i.m. injections of paliperidone palmitate (150 mg eq. deltoid injection of paliperidone palmitate on Day 1, followed by 25, 100, or 150 mg eq. of paliperidone palmitate i.m. on Days 8, 36, and 64). Patients randomly assigned to placebo will receive a deltoid injection of placebo on Day 1 followed by placebo on Days 8, 36, and 64., Schizophrenia|Long-acting injectable antipsychotic medication

2	Trial of Stimulus-response Potentiation in Schizophrenia, Schizophrenia is a chronic psychiatric disorder with a lifetime prevalence of 4.0 per 1,000. The introduction of antipsychotic medications in the 1950s resulted in marked clinical improvement in the symptom profile of schizophrenia, nevertheless the disease still contributes to a significant proportion of global disease burden in terms of both morbidity and mortality. In this regard, cognitive deficits and residual negative symptoms are considered major contributing factors to psychosocial disability and poor functional outcome associated with the disorder.||Higher-order cognitive functions; e.g. working memory and executive functions; show variable deficits and are considered a core clinical symptom of schizophrenia. On the other hand, the disorder is also characterized by abnormalities at the basic level of primary sensory processing, i.e. auditory, visual and somatosensory processing. Such abnormalities in the primary process of sensory perception could change the sensory experiences of schizophrenia patients and thus contribute to the psychopathology.||Event-related potentials (ERPs) are the neurophysiological correlates of sensory processing. ERP abnormalities have been widely described in schizophrenia literature: Pre-pulse inhibition of startle (PPI) in which a weaker pre-stimulus (pre-pulse) inhibits the reaction to a subsequent strong startling stimulus (pulse) is impaired in schizophrenia. P50 suppression, a measure of sensory gating, is also often absent or reduced in the disorder. N100; a measure of basic auditory sensory perception; shows significant amplitude reduction in patients compared to controls. Mismatch negativity (MMN), a measure of automatic deviance detection and shows characteristic attenuation in schizophrenia. P300, which is involved in higher-level stimulus evaluation and categorization, also shows abnormalities along the disease course.||In the study by Clapp et al., 2005, auditory high frequency stimulation (tetanizing stimulation) resulted in an increase in auditory-evoked potentials (AEPs) in healthy individuals; i.e. an increase in N1 amplitude that persisted even after stimulation. This augmentation of N1 amplitude was regarded as a result of plastic synaptic potentiation similar to long-term potentiation (LTP) described after electrical tetanic stimulation in cellular studies. Similar findings were later replicated by Lei et al., 2017, where they used pure tones, narrow band noises and white noise to induce stable potentiation and augmentation of N1 amplitude., 0
0	Does Minimally Invasive Surgery Reduce Anxiety?, Hysterectomy is the most common gynecological procedure worldwide. . There has been a increasing interest towards to more minimally invasive procedures in the past decade. Hysterectomy operation anxiety is a complex phenomenon affected by various parameters. Patients' anxiety may be affected by their age, gender, educational status,type of operation and personality. Each patient's anxiety was measured using Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory immediately before, immediately after the operation., 0
2	A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Seroquel in Chinese Han Patients With Schizophrenia, This is a rater- blind, parallel assignment, randomized and active controlled study. The subjects investigated are outpatients or inpatient with schizophrenia from the Chinese Han race. The screening phase lasts for 1 week. The eligible patients enter the next randomized treatment phase. The titration duration is 1 week. After the first week, the patients are administered with a flexible dose regimen. In this study, the effective doses range of seroquel and risperidone are 600-750mg/d and 3-6mg/d respectively and the treatment duration lasts for 6 weeks.||The efficacy and safety of seroquel in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia have been confirmed by multiple double blind studies. This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of seroquel in the treatment of Chinese Han patients with schizophrenia. Therefore, the single blind and active control design should be selected for this study. The drug titration method and dose are within the range specified in the instruction and patients with schizophrenia are tolerant to the drug in clinical treatment.||The purpose of schizophrenic patient treatment is to improve the core symptoms, prevent suicide and other aggressive behavior, alleviate the side reactions caused by the drug, and recover the life functions of patients. Generally, the treatment in the acute phase lasts for 6 to 8 weeks. In this study, the treatment in the acute phase lasts for 6 weeks.||The rating scales used in this study are standard psychiatric rating scales with good validity and are widely used in the study of antischizophrenia drugs and in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia in China. The PANSS is developed from two early rating scales, namely the brief psychiatric rating scale (BPRS) and the psychiatric rating scale. The high inter-investigator reliability and repeated measurement reliability of these scales have been proved by multiple studies. The clinical global impression (CGI) is a simple but convenient global impression scale. It is applicable to any patients treated and studied by the psychiatric department. The Carlgary depression scale for schizophrenia (CDSS) is used to evaluate the depressive symptoms of patients with schizophrenia. It has good reliability and validity. The abnormal involuntary movement scale (AIMS) is another evaluation tool consisting of 12 items. The AIMS is used to evaluate the abnormal involuntary movements related to antischizophrenia drugs. The AIMS is nearly the most frequently used multi-item rating scale evaluating of tardive dyskinesia. The Simpson and Angus scale (SAS) is also a rating scale commonly used since its release in 1970. The validity of SAS has been verified in the double blind and placebo-controlled study involving two haloperidol doses., schizophrenia|antipsychotics|quetiapine|risperidone|efficacy|safety|multicenter|rater-blind|randomized|chinese|han
2	"The Effects of Cannabis Use in People With Schizophrenia on Clinical, Neuropsychological and Physiological Phenotypes, The trial will be a double two period (visit) blind cross-over trial with one arm dronabinol 10 mg one arm a placebo control. The order of doses and placebo will be randomized with the restriction that half of the subjects will receive each order. This counterbalances possible visit effects or learning effects associated with the visits. The use of an oral cannabis analog is not equivalent to smoking as the onset of action is slower. This is why people who use dronabinol for chronic pain prefer to smoke cannabis. There is no ""high"" associated with dronabinol. However, the active ingredients are the same, THC, which will have similar effects on the cannabinoid 1 receptor. Ethically, we did not feel we could ask people to smoke cannabis on one day of study. Subjects will present to the GCRC at 5:00 p.m. They will abstain from use of cannabis overnight. The following morning, at 8:00 a.m., the subject will provide a urine sample for a toxicology screen and a blood sample for quantitative THC levels. They will then be administered either 10 mg of dronabinol or an identical placebo on an alternate day. The subject will then have a baseline assessment of clinical positive and negative symptoms measured by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). The majority (70-90%) of people with schizophrenia smoke cigarettes. Thus, it is likely that in this population that smokes cannabis, 100% will also be cigarette smokers. The effects of nicotine via cigarette smoking on the endophenotypes studied is an acute effect, with a peak at about 5 minutes. To preclude nicotine effects on endophenotypes, we have the patient not smoke for 20 minutes prior to and during testing. Nicotine is quickly removed from the body when inhaled and its effects wear off within 20 minutes. Two hours after administration, the subject will perform the following tests: P50 auditory evoked potential- the recording will consist of the presentation of 5 sets of 16 click pairs with an intrapair interval of 500 ms heard through headphones with a 3-minute rest between sets. Brain wave responses will be recorded; neurocognitive assessment-the California Verbal Learning Test will measure verbal memory and the Stroop will measure inhibition; clinical symptom assessment- The BPRS will again be administered measure positive and negative symptoms; and a blood sample will be collected for quantitative THC levels. They will then be escorted by a Clinical Research Center nurse over to a laboratory at Colorado Psychiatric Hospital to perform smooth pursuit eye movements In performing smooth pursuit eye movements, they will watch a dot moving across a computer screen while infrared sensors that are placed just in front of their eyes record their eye movements. Each subject performs 3 trials of one minute each, with 2 minutes rest between each recording. Subjects will be reassessed by the BPRS for drug exacerbation of symptoms, will have vitals, will be checked for adverse effects, will perform a sobriety test (the standard test used in roadside testing i.e. walking a straight line and finger to nose testing) which will be assessed by Dr. Olincy, who is experienced in assessing sobriety, to assure that the patient is not acutely intoxicated and able to perform normal functions that require coordination. If they fail the sobriety test, they will be asked to remain in the (General Clinical Research Center (GCRC) until they can pass the sobriety test. Otherwise, they will then will be discharged at 5:00 p.m. Transportation to and from the GCRC will be by a provided cab service. Subjects will be randomized in blocks of 4 or 6 to the order in which they receive placebo or dronabinol. The interval between the two days of testing will be 1 week., schizophrenia|dronabinol|P50|cannabis|memory|symptoms"

2	Treating Schizophrenia by Correcting Abnormal Brain Development, It is hypothesized that enhancement of GABA neurotransmission during the early course of the illness by tiagabine (Gabitril), a GABA transporter GAT-1-specific inhibitor and a FDA-approved anticonvulsant, will improve both clinical symptoms and working memory in schizophrenia. This improvement is postulated to be the result of tiagabine-mediated modification of the developmental synaptic pruning of prefrontal cortical circuitry. The occurrence of circuitry modification after tiagabine treatment will be assessed by the following independent methodologic approaches: MRI morphometric analysis of prefrontal gray matter volume and fMRI measurements of brain activity patterns during performance of tasks that probe working memory., Treatment|fMRI|Cognition|Brain development
2	An Efficacy and Safety Study of Long Acting Injectable Risperidone and Oral Risperidone in Participants With Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder, This is a randomized (treatment group assigned by chance), open-label (all involved people know the identity of the study drug), active-controlled study to evaluate the improvement in social functioning among participants with schizophrenia taking LAI risperidone and oral risperidone tablet. The study drug will be administered for 52 weeks in flexible dose (range as per Investigator's discretion) and a total of 11 assessment visits will be conducted per participant, including Screening. The participant may be withdrawn from the trial for any medical reason at the sole discretion of the investigator. Before starting the study treatment, participants undergo the period of switching from the previous medication to risperidone for 4 weeks, and then they will be evaluated for tolerability for 2 weeks (run-in period for stabilizing to risperidone). In this 2-week period, participants will take oral risperidone. The efficacy will be primarily evaluated through Personal and Social Performance Scale. Safety will be evaluated through Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale, Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale, and Simpson-Angus Rating Scale. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study., Schizophrenia|Risperidone|Risperdal
0	An Online Home-based Intervention for Anxiety Regulation, Anxiety disorders, defined by excess worry, hyperarousal and fear, are amongst the most common class of psychiatric conditions in adults. Large population-based studies on anxiety disorders estimated a lifetime prevalence of 33.7% and a 12-month prevalence between 2.4% and 29.8%. In Singapore, however, studies have only established the prevalence of a limited range or anxiety disorders. In a nationwide, cross-sectional, epidemiological survey, the lifetime prevalence of anxiety disorders, specifically Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, rose from 0.9% and 3.0% respectively in 2010, to 1.6% and 3.6% in 2016. If untreated, anxiety disorders could result in a range of personal and societal costs, such as interpersonal dysfunctions, employment, physical health, social functioning, and frequent primary and acute care visits, resulting in a poor quality of life.||A large proportion of the population experiences subclinical symptoms of anxiety disorders which impede daily functioning and well-being, but most often do not seek professional help or fall below the radar of psychiatric services. Current treatment guidelines recommend pharmacotherapy (i.e. selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs] or venlafaxine) and psychotherapy (i.e. cognitive behavior therapy [CBT]) as first-line treatments for anxiety disorders. Unfortunately, SSRIs are associated with an increased risk of suicide in young adults. Thus, local practices often incorporate more psychological therapies in the treatment of anxiety disorders. However, CBT is labor-intensive and time-consuming - which is incompatible with the demanding lifestyle Singaporeans lead these days. Moreover, therapeutic outcomes are also very much therapist dependent. Due to the fear of stigma that is particularly salient in the local context, individuals with anxiety may be deterred from engaging with therapists. Even if these individuals do receive adequate treatment, existing literature shows that outcomes for recommended treatment modalities are sub-optimal at best, i.e. overall mean remission rate of CBT is 51% while pharmacotherapy is significantly lower. With the low rates of help-seeking behaviors and dismal success rates of existing therapies, novel interventions for anxiety are apposite and vital.||The benefits of mindfulness-based interventions have been extensively researched in anxiety disorders in recent years. Improvements reported across a range of outcomes include enhanced ability to cope with stress, reduced depressive and anxiety symptom severity, as well as improved sleep quality, all of which lead to increased life satisfaction and overall well-being. Not all anxiety regulation strategies are helpful, and mindful emotion regulation presents one promising strategy by cultivating a changing of relationship with one's emotions. Specifically, this strategy facilitates reduced reactivity to emotional stimuli by encouraging one to meet, accept, and detach from one's aversive feelings, thoughts, and ineffective habitual responses. Unfortunately, clinically anxious individuals with no experience in such practices could find it challenging to engage in them as they often require a high degree of individual discipline. Coupled with the fact that sustained practice is crucial to yield the benefits of mindfulness practice, an appealing mode of treatment delivery is necessary. To this end, gamification strategies could be useful: gamification strategies have been shown useful in motivating health-related behaviors through interaction with the immersive interventional programs. Recent preliminary studies have also suggested that neuro-/ biofeedback-based relaxation and mindfulness training is useful for both healthy and anxious individuals.||Accordingly, we have developed an online, home-based, personalized, neuro-technological mindfulness-based intervention and seek to conduct a preliminary study with healthy young adults to evaluate its safety and acceptability. Our technology will deliver a mindfulness-based anxiety regulation intervention through a neuro-/ bio-feedback-based game interface that is driven by an electroencephalography (EEG) algorithm. We hypothesize that the intervention would be safe and acceptable. We further hypothesize that the intervention would help entrain anxiety regulation and ameliorate anxiety in healthy adults., Anxiety|Biofeedback|Intervention
0	"Attention Training for Underserved Youth With Anxiety, The main aim of this pilot study is to examine the feasibility, tolerability, and acceptability of a computerized attention training program for children who have clinically elevated anxiety. Youth from a rural Latino community, with significant anxiety symptoms (N = 52) will be randomized to an active attention bias modification program (AMP) for four weeks or to an attention control condition (nonactive) for four weeks. Families will be assessed at baseline, mistreatment, post-treatment and 3 month followup. AMP responders will be determined by reduction on a self-report measure of anxiety and a clinician administered assessment. Community health workers (promotoras) will be trained to administer the program to youth. Data will be gathered to examine the feasibility, tolerability, and acceptability of this type of treatment and this mode of service delivery. It is hypothesized that the AMP will be feasible, tolerable, and acceptable to this underserved community sample of ethnic minority youth.||Study Design: Following ascertainment of study eligibility and completion of baseline assessment, youth will be assigned to four weeks of AMP or ACC (attention control condition). All youngsters and their families will undergo a comprehensive baseline assessment and be reassessed at mistreatment, treatment endpoint (week 4) and 3 month followup.||Screening: Youth will be recruited through various mechanisms.||Flyers will be posted in primary care clinics in Imperial Valley and Los Angeles County. Clinicas de Salud del Pueblo is a private, non-profit corporation providing primary care services throughout Imperial County. Flyers will be posted in the 10 primary care clinics, located in Imperial County.|The second method for recruiting subjects will be through physician referral from providers within the primary care systems. Prior to the study start, all pediatricians/providers will receive information about the study, symptoms of child anxiety, and the use of a short screening measure to assist in detecting child anxiety. If a provider at one of the clinics identifies a child with anxiety or a parent reports that child has symptoms consistent with anxiety (fears, worries, nervousness, unexplained somatic complaints, etc.), the provider will have the option to explain the study to the parent and give them the study brochures. Alternatively, providers, if able, can also ask parents to sign a consent to contact form, giving the research team permission to contact them directly to discuss the study.|Providers may also chose to refer the patient to the study promotora who will assist will explaining the study to the participant, screening, and consenting the participants.|Flyers will also be posted at Sun Valley Behavioral Medical Center, a private medical clinic that serves the medical and mental health needs of children, adolescents and adults in Imperial County. In this case, parents will be expected to call our research team for more information.|The co-PI on this study, Dr. Denise Chavira has an ongoing school based study being conducted with high school students in Imperial Valley. Given that this study covers a range of ages (8-17), we will also recruit from high schools. As part of the existing consent form (for protocol 14-000663), students are asked to check the box if they are interested in participating in future research studies. We will contact those students who have indicated interest in future studies to discuss the current project.||In all of these methods, the community health worker/promotora/e will contact the parent to conduct an initial screen. Thereafter the promotora and/or research coordinator will arrange an in person meeting with the parent and youth to review the consent with the parent and assent form with the youth and administer the eligibility measures. The initial eligibility assessments will not be conducted until all consent/assent forms have been signed and returned to the research team.||At the end of the eligibility visits, the PIs (Chavira and Chang) will review the questionnaires to determine final eligibility. Those who are eligible will process to the baseline visit where they will receive the AMP or ACC program as well as other measures. We have included a table of these measures as well as the assessment schedule in 10.1 section 1.0.||Attention Modification Program: AMP is a modified version of the dot-probe paradigm similar to the original task used by MacLeod, Mathews, and Tata. Each trial begins with a fixation cross presented in the center of the computer screen for 500 ms. The cross is then replaced by a pair of faces presented in the center of the screen for 500 ms. The face pair disappears and a probe (i.e., the letter ""E"" or ""F"") appears immediately in the location of one of the two faces. Participants will be instructed to decide whether the letter is an E or an F and press the corresponding mouse button. The letter probe will remain on the screen until the participant responds. Response latencies to identify the probe will be recorded from the onset of the presentation of the letter probe to the button press. A total of 288 training trials will be delivered each session. This paradigm has been modified to facilitate an attention bias away from threatening material. In this case, the probe always replaces the neutral face. Thus, although there will be no specific instruction to direct attention away from the threatening face, on all trials, the position of the neutral face will indicate the position of the probe.||Attention Control Condition: Like AMP, the attention control condition is a dot-probe task that begins with a fixation cross presented in the computer screen for 500ms, is followed by a pair of faces (one neutral, one threatening) for 500ms, and then a trial is completed when the face pair disappears and a probe (letter ""E"" or ""F"") appears in the location of one of the two faces. Participants will be instructed to decide whether the letter is an E or an F and press the corresponding mouse button. The letter probe will remain on the screen until the participant responds. Response latencies to identify the probe will be recorded from the onset of the presentation of the letter probe to the button press. A total of 288 training trials will be delivered each session. However, in this case, the probe replaces both the neutral and threat face 50% of the time.||Assessment. All parents and children enrolled in the study will complete assessments at baseline, mid-treatment, post-treatment and 3 month followup. Assessments will focus on feasibility outcomes and clinical outcome measures. Further, measures of moderating factors will be included in order to better understand variables (e.g., poverty, attention control, acculturation) that may suggest trends in differential treatment response within the two conditions., attention training, youth, latino"

0	Emotion-Focused Mindfulness Therapy: A Feasibility Study for Late Life Anxiety, The purpose of this small scale RCT is to determine the feasibility and acceptability of EFMT among community dwelling older adults who experience anxiety. This study has the following three aims: to determine if participants can be recruited, enrolled, and retained; to determine if participants can adhere to all components of the intervention; and to determine the extent to which participants who receive the intervention have decreased levels of anxiety compared to those who do not receive the intervention. The secondary outcomes will be to determine the extent to which participants who receive the intervention have improved sleep quality, and improved subjective memory functioning compared to those who do not receive the intervention.||This will be a small pilot RCT study that will use a wait list control trial design. Participants will be randomly allocated to either the intervention or control group. Emotion-Focused Mindfulness Therapy (EFMT) is a group intervention consisting of eight weekly meetings of 2.5 hours with 10 - 12 participants per group. Participants are provided instruction that encourages noting and experiencing bodily sensations and emotions during meditations. Meditations are conducted in silence for between twenty and thirty-five minutes, and then participants are asked to journal their recollection of the meditation and experiences that arise for them as they journal. Following journalling, each participant describes their experience in meditation, with the facilitator offering empathic exploration to support transforming negative emotions into adaptive emotions.||The study will be conducted in an online delivery PHIPPA protected platform and has been modified to accommodate electronic delivery. Maximum number of participants per group will be six, and each session will be 1.5 hours. Data will be collected at three points by a research assistant to evaluate the feasibility of EFMT for older adults and determine whether anxiety is influenced by the intervention., anxiety|aging and health|adults aged 65 and older|mindfulness based intervention|meditation

The third aim is to describe the relationships among the process variables of the intervention.||Nakagawa-Kogan's self-management nursing model, Kanfer's self-regulation theory, and Liberman's theory of stress and vulnerability provide the theoretical basis for the self-management intervention developed specifically for a population with deficits in cognitive processing. The intervention involves training in symptom awareness, stress management skills, problem-solving, and social skills. Parents and siblings are included to gain knowledge and skills to support the adolescents.||The adolescent's level of functioning is assessed using the Child and Adolescent Functional Assessment Scale, the Birchwood Early Signs & Symptoms Scale for schizophrenia, and the DISA. Family Functioning is assessed by computing a Composite Family Functioning Index using weighted scores from the FACES II, Family Apgar, Family Empowerment, and Family Social Support scales. One parent is designated by the family to be the family respondent on the scales. The adolescents are referred to the study by mental health professionals. The intervention is administered in small multiple-family groups in 12 sessions over 7-1/2 months. Data are collected at 4 points in time: at baseline, after 6 intensive sessions, after 6 monthly reinforcement sessions, and 6 months post-intervention. ANCOVA is used to test the study hypotheses. Multivariate relationships are examined among the process variables of the intervention., Adolescence|Family|Female|Human|Male|Schizophrenia|Self Care|Community Health Services
2	A Double-Blind Trial of Adjunctive Valacyclovir to Improve Cognition in Early Phase Schizophrenia, One hundred and seventy-five participants (N=70 HSV-1 seropositive and N=105 HSV-1 seronegative) will be randomized 1:1 to receive adjunctive valacyclovir or adjunctive placebo for a 16 week period. The primary outcome that will be assessed is improvement in changes in visual and working memory scores in HSV-1 positive and negative participants over the course of the study. We will also measure the overall cognitive functioning and the severity of psychiatric symptoms over the course of the study and will evaluate the tolerability and safety of valacyclovir treatment in this population. In addition, we will explore the relationship between changes in the levels of inflammatory markers (HSV2, CMV, EBV, CRP, and Toxoplasmosis) and treatment response over the course of the study., schizophrenia|schizoaffective|schizophreniform|inflammatory markers|HSV1|cognition|early psychosis|valacyclovir

2	Evaluation of Effectiveness and Safety of Paliperidone ER (Extended-release) Compared With Quetiapine in Patients With Schizophrenia, This is a randomized (patients are assigned different treatments based on chance), double blind (neither the patient nor the physician knows whether drug or placebo is being taken, or at what dosage), placebo controlled, parallel group study to compare the efficacy and safety of paliperidone ER with quetiapine in the treatment of patients who have schizophrenia and are acutely ill. The duration of the study is 42 days. During the first phase (Day 0 - Day 14) patients receive increasing doses of the treatment to which they are assigned (starting with 3mg and increasing to 9 mg or 12 mg of paliperidone ER; starting with 50 mg and increasing to 600 mg or 800 mg of quetiapine; or the same number of capsules of placebo). During the second phase (Day 15 - Day 42), patients continue to take the dose of medication they received on day 14, but may also receive other medications if the investigator determines they are needed to treat ongoing symptoms. The hypothesis of the study is that paliperidone ER is better than quetiapine in the short term for treating acutely ill patients with schizophrenia. Primary outcome is change on the total score of the PANSS (Positive and Negative Syndrome scale for Schizophrenia) in the first phase of the study (Day 0 - Day 14). Secondary outcomes include time to response, time to readiness for discharge, and additional medication use in the second phase of the study (Day 15- Day 42) for patients receiving paliperidone ER compared to quetiapine. Safety of paliperidone ER compared with quetiapine throughout the study (Day 0 - Day 42) will be based on reported adverse events, results of laboratory tests (hematology, biochemistry, and urinalysis), vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, and weight), electrocardiogram, and movement disorder scales (Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale, Barnes Akathisia Scale, and Simpson-Angus Rating Scale). Patients may participate in a pharmacogenomic (DNA) analysis, if they choose to do so. Patients receive study drug by mouth for a total of 42 days. Study medications will be increased to maximum tolerated doses of Paliperidone ER 9mg or 12mg/day and Quetiapine 600mg or 800mg at day 8. From day 15 through day 42 (end of study) all patients will be eligible for additional psychotropic medications at investigators' discretion., Schizophrenia|Antipsychotic|paliperidone|quetiapine|Seroquel|placebo

2	Appetite Increase in Schizophrenia Patients Treated With Atypical Antipsychotics, Atypical antipsychotics (AAP) have revolutionize treatment of schizophrenia. They are considered to be more effective in reducing positive and negative symptoms and in improving cognitive deficits. They cause less extrapyramidal symptoms and tardive dyskinesia than typical antipsychotics. They still have a lot of important side effects like sedation, metabolic syndrome and weight gain. These effects could lead to obesity, type II diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, particularly for schizophrenia patients because they are already at an increased risk for these complications. Moreover, an increase in weight gain has been demonstrate to exacerbate negative symptoms and can lead to non compliance with a consequent risk of relapse. It also can create an additional social disadvantage for schizophrenia patients and decrease their quality of life. The weight gain will result, in part from an increased food intake (and probably an increased appetite) and from a decreased energy expenditure.||The purpose of this study is to understand the cerebral mechanisms of appetite in patients with schizophrenia treated with atypical antipsychotics to prevent or treat their weight gain., Schizophrenia|Atypical antipsychotics|Weight gain|Appetite|fMRI

2	Effect of Sarcosine on Symptomatology, Quality of Life, Oxidative Stress and Glutamatergic Parameters in Schizophrenia, Glutamic acid is the largest excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, the population of glutamatergic neurones represents approximately 50% of all neurones in the brain. Being closely dependent on the inhibitory GABA system, the glutamate system is responsible for the transmission and modulation of the majority of brain signals and connected with dopaminergic and serotonergic systems. The glutamate system plays an important role in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. NMDA receptor antagonists, including phencyclidine, ketamine and MK-801, cause symptoms similar to those found in schizophrenia, as well as deterioration of mental state in patients with schizophrenia. What is important from a theoretical point of view NMDA agonists also cause negative symptoms which are not observed after amphetamine or other drugs intoxications. Based on these observations, it was assumed that normalization of glutamatergic transmission may result in an improvement in schizophrenia symptomatology.||According to the assumptions of this hypothesis, attempts were made to stimulate transmission within this system. Due to the high risk of excitotoxic effects induction therapy with glutamic acid is not administered (hyperactivity of glutamatergic system, leading to nerve cell damage was observed in neurodegenerative diseases). Along with glutamic acid and voltage changes dependent on another glutamatergic receptor - AMPA, presence of glycine is necessary to stimulate the NMDA receptor. This widely distributed amino acid, an important element of protein chains, is present in a daily diet (average consumption amounts to 2g/day). In addition to building properties, it is of paramount importance in the central nervous system. As a primary transmitter in glycinergic neurones it belongs to the class I of neurotransmitters. Moreover, it also plays a role as a co-agonist and a modulator, for example in the glutamatergic system. Glutamic acid is released from nerve endings into the synaptic cleft, where it is re-uptaken and dispersed, which, in consequence, results in a rapid decline in its concentration in the vicinity of NMDA receptors. As a result, the time of receptor binding is short. Intrasynaptic glycine turnover is different - it resides inside the synapses permanently, depending on the concentration and, to a greater or lesser extent, binds to a modulatory site. Glial cells, with identified glycine transport system (GlyT-1) are responsible for maintaining a stable level of glycine in neuronal junctions. New research on inhibitors of this transport system (GTI) eg. sarcosine, which may have similar or better effects to glycine administration, have begun. Glycine does not bind to all the modulatory sites on NMDA receptor in vivo, and augmentation of this saturation intensifies glutamatergic transmission. This phenomenon is particularly observed in individuals with relatively low (not sufficient for maximum saturation of the receptor site) levels of synaptic glycine.||We hypothesize that supplementation of sarcosine helps achieve betterment in symptomatology, general quality of life and also cognitive functioning and other prefrontal derivatives, eg. oculomotor functions.||To extend research we planned assessing blood levels of glycine, sarcosine but also other parameters involved in glutamatergic transmission such as BDNF and metalproteinase MMP-9. Knowing excitotoxic properties of glutamate TBARS (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances) - oxidative stress related will be assessed.||Methodology of the study. We plan to enroll 60-70 patients in stable mental state meeting criteria for schizophrenia according to ICD-10 with predominant negative symptoms (minimum of 21 points and severity of each negative symptom at least 3 points in PANSS-Negative subscale).||Main study part will be continued for 26 weeks (T0-T26) and 10 visits (W1-W10). The preceding 12-week period (W0-W1) will be used for evaluation of stability of mental state and pharmacotherapy.||Patients on visit T0 will be randomized to two comparable groups of 30 patients (sarcosine and control group). Researchers and patients will not have information on the administered treatment.||During the study patients will receive previous antipsychotic treatment (at least 3-month without dosage change). Mental stability will be assessed during the preceding period (W1 and W0 visit - 12 weeks before W1). Sarcosine (or placebo) will be augmented between visits W1 and W9, the subsequent period (between W9 and W10), will be used to evaluate the consequences of withdrawal sarcosine (and placebo).||Information on the history of the disease, and current mental status will be obtained during the psychiatric examination, in part, standardized by the use of commonly accepted psychiatric scales (PANSS, Calgary Depression Scale, CGI, SAS and quality of life and sexual activity scales). Assessment of the use of psychiatric scales will be used on each of the visits.||As the basic tools used to study cognitive functioning test Wisconsin Card Sorting (WCST), Trail Making Test (TMT) and Stroop Test will be used. Psychological testing will be performed by a psychologist on visits W1, W6 and W9.||Assessment of metabolism of glycine and glutamic acid in brain tissue in the frontal cortex and hippocampus using magnetic resonance spectroscopy, electrooculography, parameter of oxidative stress - T-BARS and blood assessments (glycine, sarcosine, BDNF and MMP-9) will be performed on visits W1 and W9., glutamic acid|sarcosine|NMDA|schizophrenia
2	Aripiprazole Augmentation for Clozapine-Treated Patients With Refractory Schizophrenia, Clozapine is renowned for its efficacy in treating schizophrenia refractory to typical or atypical antipsychotics. Though the effectiveness of clozapine has been established, a considerable number of patients with schizophrenia are partially responsive or unresponsive to clozapine. In addition, long-term use of clozapine is associated with the development of obsessive-compulsive symptoms and metabolic syndrome. In order to overcome these short-comings and to increase efficacy, aripiprazole augmentation was implemented. Quantitative electroencephalogram will be used to monitor the occurrence of abnormal findings and to analyze the changes in electroencephalographic pattern with linear and non-linear methodology.||Comparisons: Design of double-blind randomized placebo controlled study of patients at Refractory Schizophrenia Clinique in Department of Neuropsychiatry at Seoul National University Hospital., schizophrenia|aripiprazole|clozapine

2	Study of a Neurocognition Enhancing Agent in Patients With Schizophrenia, Aims:||Schizophrenia is one of the most disabling disorders to afflict mankind. Despite the low lifetime prevalence of schizophrenia (1% world-wide), it has an enormous burden in both economic cost and human suffering. There is currently no cure for schizophrenia and its cause is not well understood. Patients with schizophrenia also suffer from negative symptoms (loss of drive, apathy, poverty of speech) and severe cognitive impairments especially with memory, attention, processing of information - the latter of which is most robustly correlated with their role functioning in the community. Addressing these impairments with effective interventions is thus critically important but at this present moment, there is no effective treatment. Recent emerging data from animal studies and a pilot study on small group of patients with schizophrenia suggest that neurosteroids such as pregnenolone may be relevant to schizophrenia pathophysiology and treatment of neurocognitive impairments. This study will be a 10-week randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial of the efficacy and safety of pregnenolone. Our hypothesis is patients with schizophrenia randomized to pregnenolone will demonstrate significant improvements in cognitive functioning and negative symptoms compared to patients receiving placebo. The primary aims of the study are to demonstrate the efficacy of pregnenolone in comparison to placebo in patients with schizophrenia which are assessed by changes (from baseline) in the composite score of the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB), BACS and the Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS). Changes in functionality will be assessed by the University of California Performance Based Skills Assessment (UPSA). Safety will be assessed with laboratory tests, well established scales for side effects as well as with a side-effects checklist.||Objectives:||To demonstrate the efficacy of pregnenolone in comparison to placebo in patients with schizophrenia and with cognitive impairment from randomization (Week 2) to Week 10 by using MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery, BACS, Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms, Performance Based Skills Assessment - Brief Version and Clinical Global Impression -Improvement (CGI-I).Additional safety data on pregnenolone in patients with schizophrenia will be provided.||Methodology:||The proposed study is a single-site, randomized, double blind placebo-controlled comparison of adjunctive pregnenolone and placebo. A total sample will consist of 120 clinically stable inpatients and outpatients with DSM IV schizophrenia, with 60 subjects randomized to each group. A best estimate diagnostic approach will be utilized, in which information from the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV will be supplemented by information from family informants, previous psychiatrists, and medical records to generate a diagnosis. There will be a 2 week, single-blind placebo lead-in evaluation phase, in which subjects will undergo baseline diagnostic and medical testing, including a physical examination, Electrocardiogram (ECG), Complete Blood Counts (CBC), complete metabolic panel, urine toxicology, and urinalysis. The study is designed to confirm the pilot study results (n=9 per group; total of 18 patients of 21 randomized who completed at least 4 weeks of treatment) in a larger clinical trial (n=60 per group, 120 patients total). Identical to our pilot study, patients will be seen for a total of 6 study visits (every two weeks). The placebo arm is essential as there are no standard therapies for cognitive defects as yet.||Potential Benefits:||While patients may not personally be helped by taking part in this study, their participation may lead to knowledge that will help better understand the illness. It may also lead to better treatment for cognitive deficits and negative symptoms in schizophrenia.||Potential Risks:||Obtaining blood can cause pain, bleeding, bruising, or swelling at the site of the needle prick. There is a risk that some questions on the questionnaires might upset the patients or cause psychological distress. There are no known severe risks that had been associated with taking pregnenolone., Schizophrenia|Pregnenolone|Neurocognition
2	Treatment Response to Rehabilitation in Patients With Schizophrenia, Patients with schizophrenia often suffer neurocognitive impairment and psychosocial and vocational difficulties. This study will help identify those patients most likely to benefit from existing behavioral treatments and provide clues for how to modify treatments for those who do not benefit.||Two studies will be conducted. The first will investigate the relationship of symptoms and neurocognitive variables at study entry to psychosocial and vocational status 2 years later. The second study will investigate the relationship of symptoms and neurocognitive variables at study entry to treatment response in patients assigned to either a cognitive remediation track or a computer skills track as part of their rehabilitation treatment.||Both the cognitive remediation and computer skills training programs will last 4 to 6 months. Participants will be assessed pre- and post-treatment. Neuropsychological, psychosocial and vocational status will be measured., 0
2	A Long Term Study of Long-acting Injectable Risperidone in the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia, This is an open-label, long-term study of a flexible dose of a long-acting injectable formulation of risperidone (risperidone LAI) injected into the muscle at 2 week intervals for at least 12 months in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia. It is an extension of an open label study of patients with schizophrenia (RIS-USA-259) switching from treatment with an oral antipsychotic medication to long-acting injectable risperidone. Safety evaluations include incidence of adverse events, physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests (biochemistry, hematology, and urinalysis), electrocardiograms (ECGs), and Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS), a scale for assessing muscle tone, gait, and abnormal movements. Efficacy assessments include measurements using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale for Schizophrenia (PANSS) and the Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Illness scale (CGI-S). Risperidone (25-50milligrams [mg]) injections, long-acting formulation, every 2 weeks for at least 1 year. Dosages may be increased (50 mgs maximum) or decreased at discretion of the investigator. Supplementary risperidone tablets (1mg) may be administered., Schizophrenia|Intramuscular injection|Antipsychotic agents|Long-acting risperidone

1	Primary Care Stepping Stones Triple P for Children With Autism, Research literature exists on best practices for screening and diagnosing children with Autism. However, less is known about how to intervene with the child's parent. Across studies, relative to parents of children without disabilities, parents of children with Autism have reported higher levels of stress and lower levels of parenting competence. Such stress places children at risk for adverse developmental outcomes||The proposed study aims to determine the effectiveness of Primary Care Stepping Stones Triple P (PC-SS Triple P), an empirically supported parent mediated intervention, to improve the behavioral functioning of children newly diagnosed with Autism (aged 2-12 years), increase parental resilience and decrease parental stress.||The specific hypotheses include:||Children whose parents receive PC-SS Triple P will demonstrate significantly greater improvements in their behavioral functioning than children of parents receiving Wait-list Control (WLC) at service closure.|At service closure, parents receiving the PC-SS Triple P intervention will be more resilient and demonstrate lower levels of stress than parents in the Wait-List Control (WLC) condition.|Parenting resilience and levels of parental stress will be positively associated with improvements in child behavior.||Seventy-six parents of children newly diagnosed with Autism will be randomized into one of two conditions: a) PC-SS Triple P (N=38) or b) Wait List Control (WLC; N=38). Study data will be collected with the assistance of a data collector appropriately trained in human subject rights protections.||It is anticipated that the present project will assist in the development and use of evidence-based practices for working with parents of children newly diagnosed with Autism within pediatric settings., Parental Resilience|Parental Stress|Family Adaptation|Autistic Disorder|Behavior|Child Behavior|Child Development Disorders|Pervasive Developmental Disabilities|Caregivers|Parents|Parenting|Primary Health Care
0	Anxiety Levels in Adolescents Undergoing Endoscopy, Although anxiety is known to be a disorder that is much more relevant for adults, it is seen at a frequency of approximately 6.5% in the childhood and adolescence. Anxiety is usually examined in two different forms, state anxiety and trait anxiety. A total of 180 pediatric patients who underwent GIS endoscopy in our hospital were included in our study. Demographic data (age, gender, height, weight, educational status, school and grade), additional diseases and diagnoses were recorded. Our aim was to evaluate the anxiety and trait anxiety levels of adolescents scheduled for gastrointestinal system (GIS) endoscopy under sedation, after being admitted as a single-day inpatient and before the procedure. A form evaluating state and trait anxiety levels (Spielberger's state and trait anxiety scale) and another form consisting of demographic data were given to the patients. We requested that the forms be filled by the children themselves. After monitoring in the endoscopy unit, sedation was applied with IV anesthetic drugs routinely.Oxygenation was provided with nasal O2 in all patients. Heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and oxygen saturation (SpO2) were monitored. Also complications (bradycardia, tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypotension, hypertension, bronchospasm, decrease in SpO2, apnea) were recorded., Adolescent|anxiety|endoscopy|anesthesia

2	"Timing of Voluntary Movement in Patients With Schizophrenia, Objectives||The purpose of this study is to determine how the subjective sense of willing and initiating an action is altered in schizophrenic patients. One proposed explanation for characteristic symptoms of schizophrenia (""passivity phenomena"") is a defect in the forward model of movement that the brain receives as the motor signal is generated. We propose to examine this forward model using Libet's paradigm, in which normal subjects gave evidence for a forward model in their anticipatory reports of initiation of movement. We intend to determine the times associated with willing (W), initiating (M), and electroencephalographic/electromyographic (EEG/EMG) measures of movement.||Study Population||We intend to study adult patients with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders diagnosis of schizophrenia. These patients provide a unique population for this study because they often do not have the sense that they direct their own movement or author their own thoughts (passivity phenomena). Studies have shown that schizophrenics have movement-related cortical potentials on EEG, but it is not known when the subjective sense of initiating movement occurs for these patients. As the order of mental events in time has been shown to contribute to the sense of agency, it is important to know how the timing of voluntary movement is altered in schizophrenia.||Design||We will ask patients to look at a fast-rotating clock on a computer screen and note when their movements were willed, instigated by an external agent if they have such delusions, and were initiated. Patients will also report the time of a somatosensory stimulus. Surface EMG will determine the time of actual movement, and EEG will record brain potentials associated with movement. Eligible patients with schizophrenia and passivity phenomena will be recruited from the Clinical Brain Disorders Branch, NIMH.||Outcome Measures||The primary outcome measure of this study is the absence of time W in some schizophrenics, the latency of W in other schizophrenics compared to normal subjects, and the latency of M in schizophrenics compared to normals. Any effect of medication status or symptoms on performance in the study will be considered exploratory data., Bereitschafts Potential|Timing of Volition|Somatic Passivity Phenomenon|Conscious Will|Libet's Clock|Schizophrenia|Healthy Volunteer|HV"

2	Injection Site Tolerability of Multiple Dose Treatment With Long-acting Injectable Risperidone Administered Via Deltoid Muscle in Chronic Schizophrenia Patients., This is an open-label, multiple-dose, multicenter study in chronic schizophrenia patients, who are receiving long-acting injectable risperidone 25 or 37.5-mg injections into the gluteal muscle, and clinically require a higher dose. The study consists of a pretreatment screening phase, an 8-week, open label treatment phase during which patients will receive 4 sequential 2 mL injections with long-acting injectable risperidone (37.5 or 50 mg) administered every 2 weeks into the deltoid muscle in alternate arms (right versus left) for each visit; and a post treatment phase consisting of end of study evaluations upon completion of all the study procedures on Day 57 or at early withdrawal. The study hypothesis is that repeated injections of long-acting injectable risperidone into the deltoid muscle will be safe and well tolerated as assessed by the percent of patients who discontinue after at least 2 injections. Safety was assessed using adverse events (including occurrence of extrapyramidal symptoms as assessed by the Extrapyramidal Symptoms Rating Scale), clinical laboratory tests (hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis, and pregnancy testing), vital signs, physical examinations, electrocardiograms, and injection site evaluation. The patients will receive 4 injections with long-acting injectable risperidone (37.5 or 50 mg) administered as 1 injection every 2 weeks into the deltoid muscle., schizophrenia|Risperidone|Long acting injectable|Intradeltoidal injection

2	Ginkgo Biloba Extract for Schizophrenia, OBJECTIVE: There is evidence that an excessive free radical production or oxidative stress may be involved in the pathophysiology of patients with schizophrenia. The investigators hypothesize that antioxidant therapy by using an add-on agent together with a well-proven antipsychotic drug may have favorable effects on some schizophrenic patients.||METHODS:||Clinical Trial: This is a randomized, double-blind and parallel controlled trial in treatment-naive first-episode patients with schizophrenia. The study consists of a 1-week stabilization phase, followed by 10 weeks of double-blind treatment. The total trial duration is 11 weeks.|Medications: Eligible patients are randomly assigned to either capsulized EGb(240mg.day) or identically capsulized placebo addition to the risperidone (2-6mg/day) in a double-blind fashion.|Assessment Procedures:||3.1. Primary Outcome Variable-psychopathology: Assessment instruments include the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI). Patients are interviewed at screening, at baseline and at every two weeks.||3.2. Cognitive tests: A comprehensive battery of tests encompassing the cognitive domains of executive function, attention, memory, perception, and general intellect is administered twice at baseline and at the end of 10-week treatment by a trained psychologist. Scoring follows standardized procedures.||3.3. Side Effects: Parkinsonism is rated with the Simpson-Angus Scale for extrapyramidal side effects. The Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) is chosen to assess tardive dyskinesia (TD) severity. All of the AIMS and Simpson-Angus Rating Scales are administered by the same investigator at baseline and at baseline, and at week 5 and at week 10.||3.4. Plasma Measures: Venous blood from forearm vein is collected from healthy controls and patients with schizophrenia between 7 and 9 a.m. following an overnight fast. Serum Plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and catalase (CAT) activities will be analyzed using established procedures., Schizophrenia|clinical trial|risperidone|ginkgo biloba extract|antioxidant
2	An Efficacy and Safety Study of Paliperidone Palmitate in Participants With Schizophrenia, This is a randomized (the study drug is assigned by chance), double-blind (neither physician nor participant knows the name of the assigned drug), placebo-controlled (an inactive substance; a pretend treatment [with no drug in it] that is compared in a clinical trial with a drug to test if the drug has a real effect), parallel-group (comparing the response in two groups of participants receiving different treatments), fixed-dose, multi-center (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study) study of paliperidone palmitate in participants with schizophrenia. The study will consist of 3 periods: an up to 2-week pre-observation (screening) period, a double-blind period from Day 1 (baseline) to Week 13 (end of double-blind period) assessment, and a post-observation period starting after the Week 13 assessment to Week 21. For participants who discontinue the study before the last assessment in Week 13, the post-observation period will start after the discontinuation from double-blind period assessment with follow-up visits at 4, 8, and 12 weeks after the last injection. After completion of the double-blind period (Week 13), discontinuation of double-blind period treatment or withdrawal from the study, participants may receive treatment consistent with the usual standard of care. The total duration of the study will be 21 weeks, including the double-blind and post-observation periods. Participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio (intramuscular injections of either paliperidone palmitate or matching placebo). Injections of paliperidone palmitate or placebo will be given at Day 1 and at Weeks 1, 5, and 9 by a study drug manager and/or injector. For those participants receiving paliperidone palmitate, the Day 1 injection will be 150 milligram equivalent (mg eq.) paliperidone palmitate, followed by 100 mg eq. injections of paliperidone palmitate at Week 1, and 75 mg eq. injections of paliperidone palmitate at Weeks 5 and 9. Participants randomly assigned to placebo will receive injections matching the paliperidone palmitate injections on the same days. Efficacy will be assessed using Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S). Participant's safety will be monitored throughout the study., Paliperidone palmitate|Schizophrenia
0	Progressive Muscle Relaxation and Nature Sounds in Nursing Students, Background: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of PMR and nature sounds on nursing students' BPM skills, and anxiety levels and vital signs.||Methods: This was a randomized controlled experimental study conducted at the nursing department of the faculty of health sciences of a university. PMR participants rested for ten minutes between the sessions and then practiced PMR for 15 minutes. PMR consisted of taking a deep breath five times and then clenching fists, raising the shoulders, bringing the forearms towards the body, stretching the triceps muscle, and tensing and relaxing the forehead, eye, chin, neck, chest, abdomen, back, hips, thigh, and feet muscles. The investigators made a video of exercises in a certain order and uploaded it to the television in the lab prior to the intervention. The investigators turned on the video during the intervention and asked the participants to follow the instructions for PMR exercises. PMR+NS participants practiced PMR accompanied by nature sounds., Skill training|Nursing students|Anxiety|Blood Pressure Measurement Skills
2	Benefits of Physical Exercise in Schizophrenia, Difficulties in social integration pose a major mental health problem for Veterans with schizophrenia. Reviews of the literature indicate that Veterans with schizophrenia have lower marriage rates, fewer friendships, and higher rates of living alone than the general population. Poor social integration is also associated with early mortality. To gain traction on this problem, it will be necessary to find treatments that address key determinants of social integration. Evidence indicates that impairments in cognition and affect are among the key determinants of this area of functioning. Findings from the broader rehabilitation literature support a novel conceptual approach to this problem, namely engagement in physical exercise. Physical exercise is associated with improvements in attention, episodic memory, working memory, speed of processing, and executive control. In addition, physical exercise is associated with increases in positive affect and decreases in negative affect. Findings on the effects of physical exercise on cognition and affect have been reported for normal aging, mild cognitive impairment, neurodegenerative disorders, oncology, and depression, but is an area of investigation relatively new to schizophrenia. The proposed study will include 54 Veterans with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (aged 45-65) who will be matched on baseline levels of cardiorespiratory fitness, and then randomized (2:1) to a walking exercise group (n=36) or a control comparison group (n=18). Veterans in the exercise group will participate in a 12-week, instructor-led, outdoor brisk walking exercise program conducted in small groups (n=6), held 3 times per week, gradually increasing walking time until reaching a maximum of 40-minutes per session. The heart rate of each Veteran will be monitored during the walking sessions to help ensure maintenance of a target peak heart rate of 60% to 70% of the maximum for the individual's age (i.e., 220-age). Veterans in the control group will participate in instructor-led, non-aerobic stretching exercises in small groups (n=6) with the duration, frequency, and total number of sessions matched to the exercise group. Primary outcome measures of cardiorespiratory fitness, cognition, and positive and negative affect of participants in both groups will be measured at baseline and the 12-week end-point assessment., 0
1	Study of Pharmacokinetics, Safety, Efficacy, and Tolerability of Memantine in Children With Autism, This is a multicenter, two-part study in pediatric (ages 6 to 18 years) patients diagnosed with autism.||Patients participating in Part One will receive a single open-label dose of memantine. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis will be collected.||Part Two is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 12-week efficacy and safety study evaluating change in all core domains (social interactions, communication, and restricted interests and repetitive behaviors) of autism.||In the Forest autism trials conducted in children ages 6-12, dosing with an extended release formulation of memantine was weight-based. These weight based dose limits were selected to ensure exposure in terms of area under the curve (AUC) was less than the predefined limit of 2100 ng∙h/mL that represented a 10-fold lower exposure than observed at the NOAEL (No observed adverse effect level) of 15 mg/kg/day in juvenile rats.||The weight-based dose limits in these studies were as follows:||Group A: ≥ 60 kg; max 15 mg/day|Group B: 40-59 kg; max 9 mg/day|Group C: 20-39 kg; max 6 mg/day|Group D: < 20 kg; max 3 mg/day, autism|memantine|pediatric|Forest Laboratories|Autism in pediatric patients
1	"Sulforaphane-rich Broccoli Sprout Extract for Autism, Behavioral improvements occur transiently during febrile illnesses in autism, and include decreased repetitive behaviors and improved speech. These changes have been recorded in 38% of autistic children in a clinical survey and 83% in an observational study, respectively. The cellular basis for this ""fever effect"" is unknown but is likely to involve heat shock proteins (HSP) and cellular stress responses (CSR) that lead to changes in synaptic function and network connectivity.||Sulforaphane (1-isothiocyanato-4R- (methylsulfinyl)butane) is an isothiocyanate that is delivered by lyophilized extracts of 3-day-old broccoli sprouts. Broccoli sprouts are widely consumed as a food item all over the world by very large numbers of individuals, without any reports of adverse effects. Our preliminary work in vitro shows that sulforaphane stimulates HSP and mitochondrial biogenesis in several genetic disorders.||This study of sulforaphane-rich Broccoli Sprout Extract in autism is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, phase II single site trial, designed to ensure safety and obtain efficacy data, with a focus on changes in social responsiveness, a core feature of autism. Its hybrid design, incorporating double masking, placebo control, and randomization, enhances the robustness of early outcome data. The study duration will be 2 years. Recruitment of subjects will be 50% by 8 months and complete by 14 months. All subjects in the study will be followed for 22 weeks. Treatment (18 weeks) will be started as patients are entered into the study and receive baseline testing. All treatment will be completed by 20 months and data analysis and presentation of results by 24 months.||Forty-five male adolescents (13-18 years) and adults (19-30 years) with autism will be randomly assigned to receive either sulforaphane-rich Broccoli Sprout Extract (n = 30) or placebo (n = 15). The 2:1 randomization schedule will be produced by the study statistician using permuted random blocks and stratification by history of positive behavioral effects of fever. Treatment assignments will be performed by the research pharmacy at MGH. Females will be excluded for homogeneity of the sample and because males have higher incidence of autism than females (4:1). We will seek to enroll up to 50% of the subjects having a history of positive behavioral effects of fever, which will be recorded from caregivers' recall of incidents and graded on the CGI-Improvement (CGI-I) 7-point scale.||There will be in total 7 study visits for each subject: the screening visit, enrollment visit, a blood draw visit at 24 hours after the first dose of study medication (for mitochondrial/heat shock protein analysis), 4 week (follow-up) visit, 10 week (follow-up) visit, 18 week visit (last treatment visit), and the final closeout visit one month after the study drug stops (22 weeks). Even though the treatment will stop at 18 weeks, we will follow subjects for additional 4 weeks after study medication stops (the 22 week visit) to ensure safety after study drug stops. Additional visits may be conducted in case any side effects are reported at any stage of the study., 0"

The trial will take place in KASHANI Hospital (in Isfahan).Recruitment of the participants will be identified and recruited by the neurologists of the hospitals who take part in the programme, when they come for a medical examination.||After giving their informed consent, the patients will be entered onto the trial database and randomized to either the schema therapy or control using software allocated The intervention is the schema therapy focuses on the management of anxiety and is based on self-efficacy, self-management . It consists of 20 once-weekly sessions of 90 minutes (with a 15 Min break), with homework activities between the sessions. It is designed for groups of 8 people and will be delivered by two psychologists. The programme is standardized: Power Points presentations support each session and a detailed therapist manual and companion patient workbook accompany the programme.||For the ST group an evaluation will be administered pretest and post-test six months after the end of the schema therapy programme and at the same times for those in the control group. Socio-demographic and medical data, age, sex, level of education, marital status, number of children and professional status; date of diagnosis, disease type, level of disability (EDSS, Kurtzke, 1983) and information on relapses and treatments, are evaluated.

2	"Minocycline for Schizophrenia, Minocycline has excellent penetration of the blood-brain barrier. In a mechanism that seems to be distinct from its antimicrobial properties, minocycline has anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. These properties are thought to be related to some combination of its inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS); caspase 1 and 3; p-38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK); cytochrome C release; cyclooxygenase-2 expression; prostaglandin E2 formation; and microglial activation. Minocycline has also been reported to have antiviral effects against HIV and antiprotozoal effects against Toxoplasma gondii.||Its use in individuals with schizophrenia has been encouraged by its effects in rodent models of this disorder. In one study, minocycline attenuated the behavioral changes following the administration of an NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate)antagonist in mice. In another study, minocycline reversed the effects of an NMDA antagonist in rats. Some preliminary data also suggest that minocycline may be useful in patients with schizophrenia. Two case report series have been published, one including two patients with schizophrenia and the other including three patients with recent-onset acute paranoid schizophrenia. An open label study of 22 patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia, using minocycline 150 mg/d for four weeks, reported an improvement in both positive and negative symptoms. Two double blind trials have been carried out. In one study, 73 patients with schizophrenia of less than five years' duration were randomized to minocycline 200 mg or placebo for 12 months: ""all symptom measures improved significantly"" especially in the negative symptoms. In the other study, 54 ""early phase"" (symptoms of less than five years) patients were randomized to minocycline 200 mg/d or placebo for six months; the authors reported a significant improvement in negative symptoms measured using Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) and Clinical Global Impressions scale (CGI) and a significant improvement in some test of executive function.||These initial findings encourage further replication. First, these studies are of comparatively small size. Second, in countries like Ethiopia where options for the treatment of schizophrenia are limited, identifying a safe alternative to clozapine is important. Related to this, most patients have limited exposure to psychotropic medications. Third, exposure to alcohol and substances is generally believed to be lower in the Ethiopian setting. Finally, given our hypothesis that infectious agents as a cause of schizophrenia may be more important in low and middle income countries (LAMICs) such as Ethiopia, minocycline may prove more useful. In this regard, the trial will help to explore the etiology of schizophrenia. The investigators have experience in following-up a large cohort of patients with schizophrenia and in conducting randomized controlled trials of a similar nature, which makes this proposed study feasible., 0"
2	An Open Label Multicentre Study to Determine the Dose Distribution of Paliperidone ER in Patients With Schizophrenia, This trial is a non-randomised (both patient and physician know the study drug), single arm, open label multicentre study which is aimed to evaluate the dose distribution, efficacy and safety in patients with schizophrenia who are switched from an oral atypical antipsychotic to Paliperidone ER. Newly diagnosed patients will also be included in the study. In general, the recommended Paliperidone ER dose will be 6 mg once daily, however some patients may require a higher or lower initial dose in the recommended range of 3 to 12 mg once daily. The dose can be adjusted any point during the study, to a maximum dose of 12mg/day. Flexible dosing was chosen to best mimic actual clinical practice.The study duration will be split into two phases. Phase A will be 12 weeks and Phase B which will be an optional follow up phase will be 40 weeks. Assessment of efficacy and safety will be performed in Phase A at baseline, 2, 4, 6, 9 and 12 weeks and in Phase B at 20, 28, 36, 44 and 52 weeks. At the first visit, a full psychiatric history, demographic data and physical examination will be undertaken. Throughout the study, the following procedures, documentations and evaluations will be performed: descriptions of concomitant medications; hospitalisations for psychiatric reasons; clinical deterioration; Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S) and Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) assessments; Community Treatment Order (CTO) status; weight; adherence and adverse event reporting. Physical examinations will be performed periodically. Paliperidone ER OROS will be supplied in 3 mg, 6 mg, and 9 mg tablets for oral administration. In general, the recommended Paliperidone ER dose will be 6 mg once daily, however some patients may require a higher or lower initial dose in the recommended range of 3 to 12 mg once daily. The dose can be adjusted any point during the study, to a maximum dose of 12mg/day. The study duration will be split into two phases.

2	A Study to Assess the Pharmacokinetics, Safety, and Tolerability of Paliperidone Palmitate in Patients With Schizophrenia, This is a multicenter, randomized (the study drug is assigned by chance), open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), parallel-group (each group of patients will be initiated simultaneously) study in 4 panels (A, B, C and D). Each panel will comprise 2 single-dose treatment periods. In Period 1, all patients from the 4 panels will receive an intramuscular (i.m.) injection with 1 mg paliperidone as an immediate release (IR) solution to assess tolerability and allergic or hypersensitivity reactions potentially related to paliperidone, and to establish the relative bioavailability (the extent to which a drug or other substance becomes available to the body) of paliperidone palmitate versus paliperidone IR. Patients in Panels A and C will receive an i.m. injection with 1 mg paliperidone IR solution in the gluteal muscle, and patients in Panel B and D will receive an i.m. injection with 1 mg paliperidone IR solution in the deltoid or gluteal muscle. Patients who tolerate this injection and have completed all assessments on Day 5 of Period 1 will be enrolled in Period 2. In Period 2, patients will receive a single dose of 3-month paliperidone palmitate i.m. injection at the dosages defined for each panel. The study drug injection will be followed by a 96-hour observation period in Period 1, and a 364-day or 544-day observation period in Period 2. Successive study drug administrations will be separated by a washout period (period when receiving no treatment) of at least 7 and no more than 21 days. The total study length for all patients is from 53 weeks to a maximum of 58 weeks. Patients in Panel B, if consented, and Panel D will participate in the extension period of approximately 26 weeks in order to obtain additional assessments to be able to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) profile. Pharmacokinetics explores how the drug is absorbed in the body, distributed within the body, and how it is removed from the body over time. Therefore, for those who participate in the extension period, the total study duration will be approximately 84 weeks., Schizophrenia|Paliperidone palmitate|R092670|Paliperidone|3-month formulation|Pharmacokinetics

Tubes will be labeled with the study, date, and an encrypted identification of the subject. Samples will be used for DNA extraction and measurement of serum and RBC folate and homocysteine.||Genetic Analysis:||Genes will be studied that have been identified in linkage studies of patients with schizophrenia that have compelling biology relevant to potential mechanisms of etiology or drug response. Approximately 20 candidate genes have been identified with varying levels of evidence-this number is rapidly expanding. We will review the potential list of candidate genes when we have completed collecting the sample and will identify the most promising genotypic targets for analysis. If approved by the IRB, comparisons with other populations (such as depressed patients or nonpsychiatric controls) may be performed in collaboration with other investigators.||Risks:||While the clinical assessment may be stressful, the questions contained in the diagnostic instruments do not differ from those asked in routine clinical evaluations. Phlebotomy may produce discomfort, bruising, and rarely, infection. In theory, release of genetic information to patients could be upsetting and release to other parties could represent a serious breach of privacy. Extensive precautions will be taken to prevent such an occurrence.||All DNA analyses will be performed on anonymous samples.||Subject Remuneration:||Subjects who agree to phlebotomy and complete the psychiatric evaluation will be remunerated $25 for their time. Subjects who complete the additional cognitive battery and clinical rating scales will be remunerated a total of $50 for their time., Schizophrenia|DNA
2	Trial of D-Cycloserine in Schizophrenia, To characterize further the effects of D-cycloserine augmentation of antipsychotic treatment on negative symptoms, performance on neurocognitive tasks, and on markers for glutamatergic, dopaminergic, and serotonergic function in serum and cerebrospinal fluid. To determine if negative symptoms and cognitive function improve over time, if these improvements meaningfully impact quality of life factors, if they correlate with markers of neuronal function, and if subpopulations can be identified according to response.||Dysfunction of glutamatergic neuronal systems has recently been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia based on the finding that non-competitive inhibitors of the NMDA receptor can reproduce in normals the positive symptoms, negative symptoms and cognitive deficits of schizophrenia. Furthermore, glutamatergic dysfunction may alter forebrain dopaminergic neuronal activity, a system central to the antipsychotic action of typical neuroleptics. It is believed that enhancing NMDA receptor function by systemic treatment with D-cycloserine, a partial agonist at the glycine modulatory site of the NMDA receptor, will reduce symptoms in schizophrenia.||Sixty schizophrenic outpatients with prominent, primary negative symptoms are treated with antipsychotic medication and are randomly assigned to D-cycloserine or placebo for a 6-month, fixed-dose trial. The primary outcome measure is the total score on the Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS). A neuropsychological battery, which emphasizes tests sensitive to prefrontal cortical function, is administered. Blood is obtained at several time points and CSF is obtained at Week 8 for assay of concentrations of D-cycloserine, glutamate, HVA, and 5HIAA., Adult|Cognition|Cycloserine|Dopamine|Female|Glutamic Acid|Human|Male|Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate|Schizophrenia|Serotonin|Quality of Life|Cycloserine -- *therapeutic use|Dopamine -- blood|Dopamine -- cerebrospinal fluid|Glutamic Acid -- blood|Glutamic Acid -- cerebrospinal fluid|Serotonin -- blood|Serotonin -- cerebrospinal fluid
0	Sublingual Cannabidiol for Anxiety, Cannabis has been used for medicinal purposes across many cultures for a range of disorders for thousands of years. The plant is comprised of a variety of components, such as phytocannabinoids, which include (among others) the major intoxicating constituent of cannabis, delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and cannabidiol (CBD), a major non-intoxicating constituent of cannabis. Increasing evidence indicates that CBD in particular may have significant medicinal properties and benefits; experimental studies in both animals and humans have demonstrated that CBD can act as an anticonvulsant, antipsychotic, and muscle relaxant. Several studies have demonstrated that CBD produces acute anxiolytic effects in animals and humans, although thus far no clinical trials of CBD have been conducted in patients with anxiety. As a growing number of states are legalizing medical cannabis, a gap exists in the scientific literature regarding the effects of CBD on anxiety.||This investigation is composed of two stages. Stage 1 is comprised of a four-week, open-label clinical trial of a high-CBD containing compound in individuals with anxiety. Participants will be pre-screened by phone in order to evaluate their eligibility for the study. If approved, participants will come to the hospital for a baseline/screening visit, and will complete a structured clinical interview, clinical and quality of life questionnaires, and cognitive assessments. Enrolled participants will be given CBD solution to use for the duration of the study; participants will be instructed to self-administer 1 milliliter (ml) of the tincture under the tongue three times per day for four weeks. Throughout the treatment period, participants will return to the hospital on a weekly basis to complete questionnaires about their mood and quality of life. Participants will also return to the hospital for a final visit after four weeks of treatment to complete additional questionnaires and cognitive assessments. Stage 1 of the study was completed in early 2020.||Stage 2 of the study is a double-blind clinical trial of this solution in patients with anxiety. This double-blind trial began after the open-label trial was completed. In the same manner as the open-label trial, participants will be pre-screened by phone, and approved participants will come to the hospital for a baseline/screening visit to complete a structured clinical interview, questionnaires, and cognitive assessments. Eligible participants will also have the option to complete an hour-long MRI scan at the baseline and final visits. Enrolled participants will receive either full-spectrum CBD solution, single-compound CBD solution, or placebo solution to self-administer throughout the four week treatment period, as described above. Participants will return to the hospital weekly during the treatment period to complete questionnaires about their mood and quality of life. Participants in this stage of the study will also return for a final visit after four weeks of treatment to complete additional questionnaires, cognitive assessments, and an optional hour-long MRI scan.

0	"Interpretation Training to Reduce Anxiety: Evaluating Technology-based Delivery Models and Methods to Reduce Attrition, Approximately 25-30% of the U.S. population will experience anxiety pathology severe enough to qualify for an anxiety disorder diagnosis during their lifetime. Critically, the majority will not receive treatment, creating a serious need to consider alternative approaches to delivering mental health services that can meet needs on a larger scale. Cognitive Bias Modification (CBM) interventions for anxiety hold considerable promise as a way to meet these needs. These programs alter biased ways of thinking, such as selective assignment of threat interpretations, which are known to cause and maintain anxiety. CBM for interpretation bias (CBM-I) has established efficacy when administered via computer in the laboratory, and there is clear evidence for target engagement (i.e., change in interpretations, the identified mechanism). Now, effectiveness needs to be tested in the community, using sufficiently large samples to evaluate key moderators of its effects, including delivery method (computer vs. mobile phone) and the addition of minimal human contact (for those at risk of attrition). Addressing attrition is critical given high rates of drop out for web-based interventions. Via the PI's MindTrails web site (established with the lab's prior NIMH R34MH106770 award), the lab already has the infrastructure to deliver CBM to the public and recruit large anxious samples. Moreover, the PI and Co-I have established infrastructure to do mobile sensing of mood and CBM-I delivery via mobile phones. Thus, the project can respond to NIMH's request for ""Effectiveness trials that can contribute to advancing the personalization of mental health care."" The current proposal aims to compare effectiveness and target engagement of CBM-I delivered via computer vs. mobile phone, and test if adding minimal human contact for participants at risk of dropout improves retention and outcomes. Study 1 will provide a pilot feasibility and user experience test of the CBM-I program on mobile phones. Study 2 will examine the lab's current online, computer-based CBM-I data to help determine empirical indicators of attrition. Study 3 will provide the primary test of moderators of effectiveness. Namely, in Study 3, high anxious participants will be randomized to one of 2 conditions: 1) CBM-I training delivered by computer or mobile phone (at existing MindTrails site); 2) Alternate intervention group-Psychoeducation only. CBM-I and Psychoeducation conditions include 5 weekly training sessions. Based on theoretically- and empirically-derived predictors of attrition, participants identified as high-risk for dropout in condition 1 will then be randomly assigned to add minimal human contact (using a modified TeleCoach protocol) or no change. Using this adaptive intervention, known as Sequential, Multiple Assignment, Randomized Trial (SMART), the project can test both the effects of CBM-I delivery method and the added value of human contact to improve retention for participants at high-risk for dropping out., Anxiety|Cognitive bias|Telemedicine"

2	Safety, Efficacy and Tolerability Study of Paliperidone Extended-Release (ER) in Participants With Schizophrenia, This is a single arm (one group of participants), multi-center, 6-month study to explore the tolerability, safety and efficacy of flexibly dosed paliperidone ER in participants with schizophrenia previously unsuccessfully treated with an oral antipsychotic medication. Antipsychotic medications are drugs that are helpful in the treatment of psychosis and have a capacity to ameliorate thought disorders. Unsuccessfully treated means that, despite the participant was treated with an adequate dose of an appropriate oral antipsychotic for an adequate period of time, previous treatment is considered unsuccessful due to lack of efficacy, lack of tolerability or safety, lack of compliance and/or other reasons. Throughout the study the investigators will adjust the dosage of each participant based on the individual needs. In general, the recommended paliperidone ER dose will be 6 milligram once daily. Participants can be either in- or outpatients and they may take their study drug with or without food. Participants who will complete this 6-month study and would like to continue will be eligible to be enrolled in an extension phase until paliperidone ER is available., Schizophrenia|Paliperidone|Paliperidone extended-release (ER)

2	A Study of Paliperidone Palmitate in Patients With Schizophrenia Previously Unsuccessfully Treated by Oral Antipsychotics, This is a 13-week, open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single-arm (one group of patients), multicenter, prospective, interventional study in Chinese patients. In a prospective, interventional study, the patients identified receive a treatment during the course of the research study and are followed forward in time for the outcome of the study. In China, there is still insufficient information about effectiveness, tolerability, and dosage strategy for directly switching from previous oral antipsychotics (drugs that are helpful in the treatment of psychosis and have a capacity to ameliorate thought disorders) in patients with acute symptoms. Acute symptoms are quick and severe form of illness in its early stage. In addition, there is also lack of information about bridging acute phase to long-term treatment. In this study, patients with multiple types of acute schizophrenia will be recruited and will receive Sustenna (paliperidone palmitate) treatments for 13 weeks. After the acute treatment, the patients will continue to receive the prescribed medication and will be followed up for an additional 52 weeks to assess the outcomes related to long-term treatment., Schizophrenia|Paliperidone Palmitate|Oral Antipsychotics|Invega Sustenna
2	A Pilot Trial of Acute N-Acetylcysteine Effects on Working Memory and Other Cognitive Functions in Schizophrenia, Working memory impairment in Schizophrenia is produced by deficiencies of feedback inhibition of glutamate release, due to low cysteine-glutamate antiporter activity. Because of this mechanism, we are interested in whether acute administration of N-Acetylcysteine will improve performance of patients with schizophrenia on a battery of cognitive tasks utilized to test working memory and other cognitive domains, versus placebo.

These symptoms may include emotional avoidance and numbing, difficulty relating to or connecting with friends or loved ones, difficulty sleeping, a sense of foreshortened future, and intrusive thoughts or memories related to the illness. These symptoms are an additional burden for the individual experiencing them and for their caretakers, and reduces quality of life.||Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy is an experimental treatment for anxiety disorders, and initial findings suggest that it holds promise for treatment of PTSD. This study will examine brain activity in participants enrolled in an investigation of the safety and efficacy of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in people with anxiety stemming from diagnosis with a life-threatening illness to see whether MDMA-assisted psychotherapy alters emotional reactivity to anxiety-provoking material, including positive and negative images. The study will also examine brain activity related to the experience of self-compassion/empathy in response to personalized audio scripts, and whether that response is altered by MDMA-assisted psychotherapy. Brain imaging may offer a measure of neural markers of anxiety and self-compassion that do not rely on self-report.||A subset of participants in the study ""Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Phase 2 Pilot Study of MDMA-Assisted Psychotherapy for Anxiety Associated with a Life-Threatening Illness"" (NCT02427568) without any contraindicating factors for brain imaging will undergo three fMRI scans as part of this observational study. The first scan will occur prior to experimental sessions and a second scan will occur after two experimental sessions of MDMA or placebo-assisted psychotherapy. Participants will then be scanned a third time after they have completed a total of three sessions of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy (this includes both subjects that are originally in the MDMA-assisted psychotherapy group, as well as the subjects in the placebo group who will cross over and complete three active MDMA-assisted psychotherapy sessions subsequent to their placebo-assisted psychotherapy. The primary endpoint will be the scan after the second session of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy.||During each scanning session, participants will be undergoing brain scans with functional magnetic imaging (fMRI) while they perform an emotional regulation task that involves observing images possessing negative emotional valence. These images are drawn from, and have their emotional valence validated by, the International Affective Picture System (IAPS). Participants are instructed either to view passively or attempt to reduce the negative affect associated with the images. In addition, resting state brain scans will also be acquired while subjects fixate on a central cross with no explicit task. Heart rate variability will be measured during these resting state scans. The comparison of changes in brain activity during execution of the emotional regulation task (as compared to baseline scans) after receiving psychotherapy with MDMA or placebo, as well as comparison of changes in resting state functional connectivity, are the primary outcome measures. Study observations are intended to assess changes in response to emotion-provoking material at several levels, most notably brain activity in response to anxiety producing images.||While in the scanner, subjects will also listen to prerecorded audio scripts about life stresses for themselves and for another person with instructions to practice compassion for themselves or for others. In yet another task, subjects will perform an attentional bias task where they respond to a dot-probe that appears following a brief presentation of paired images known to produce positive and negative emotions as their brain activity is measured and their reaction times are recorded, anxiety|fMRI|emotion regulation"

2	"Using Speech to Monitor Symptom Severity in Arabic Speaking Patients With Schizophrenia, Speech disorganization is a key feature of schizophrenia. The development of computerized tools to assess speech disorganization is rapidly growing in schizophrenia research. Several early studies showed that changes in speech distinguish schizophrenia patients from healthy controls and assist in differential diagnostics and relapse prevention (1). The Winterlight app can be used for speech collection and assessment and uses speech-based artificial intelligence to identify vocal biomarkers capable of detecting changes in cognitive/clinical symptoms.||Symptom rating scales remain the primary mode of assessing the nature and severity of schizophrenia and the magnitude of any change over time. The Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) is a 30-item rating scale that was developed to measure the symptom severity of patients with schizophrenia and assess their dimensions (2). It has been widely used in clinical trials of schizophrenia and is considered as the ""gold standard"" for the assessment of antipsychotic treatment efficacy.||The goal of this study is to test the hypothesis that quantitative measures derived from speech samples acquired using the Winterlight application will be associated with positive and negative symptom subscores as assessed by the PANSS.||The investigators will use speech-based artificial intelligence methods to identify aspects of voice and language that are related to schizophrenia symptoms in Arabic-speaking patients.||Data collected may be used to evaluate:||The relationship between speech measures and PANSS subscores at baseline.|The relationship between changes in speech measures and changes in positive symptoms over time.|The relationship between changes in speech measures and changes in negative symptoms over time.|The ability for speech measures to be used to predict psychotic relapse in individuals with schizophrenia.|The feasibility of predicting relapse based on speech and sociodemographic variables., Schizophrenia|Schizophrenic Disorders|Mental Disorders|Speech|Voice|Language|Natural Language Processing|Behavioral Symptoms"

0	Use of Alpha-Stim Cranial-electrotherapy Stimulation (CES) in the Treatment of Anxiety, The goal of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Alpha-Stim technology in the treatment of anxiety by using a double-blind clinical trial over a period of five weeks. Cranial-electrotherapy stimulation (CES) is a noninvasive procedure that has been used for decades in the United States to treat anxiety, depression, and insomnia. Although many studies on CES have been published in previous decades, most have used relatively small samples using various frequencies and links of treatment. Given the positive results of the many general studies that have been performed to date, this study seeks to add to the current literature by addressing previous criticisms using a large sample size (n=150)and using participants that represent more than a single type of anxiety along with comorbidity. Such a population is believed to better represent typical treatment complications.||Participants will be recruited via advertisements in a local newspaper and posting of flyers around a local university campus. Participants will be screened through an intake process using the Structured Clinical Interview for Axis I Disorders (SCID-I) to confirm a diagnosis of an anxiety disorder. Comorbid conditions are acceptable, however, an anxiety disorder must be the primary diagnosis. As part of the intake process, participants will complete the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A)and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D17) to establish a baseline. These instruments will serve as the primary efficacy measures. In order to participate, HAM-A scores must equal to or greater than 18 (Moderate Anxiety). Depression will be monitored using The HAM-D17 as depression is a commonly occurring condition with anxiety and the HAM-D17 is also sensitive to anxiety. Current treatment with medications are also acceptable provided there will be no changes in dosage or type during the study. See Inclusions and Exclusions for further information. All participants will pay a fee of $30 to enter the study to cover administration costs and as a way to measure placebo effect. Participants will be assigned a device to take home and self-administer treatment 5-7 days a week. Participants will be required to log their treatment times and dates with logs provided by the researcher. The student population will not be given a take home device but will receive treatment at the Graduate Assistant's Office or Student Care Office.||Electromedical Products International, Inc. has agreed to supply the devices needed to carry out the research to include conductance solution, felt tabs, and batteries. Half of the devices will be set by the manufacturer to deliver treatment at 0.5 Hz and at the lowest therapeutic setting. The remaining devices will be shame and not deliver any therapeutic benefit. The devices will not be able to be altered by the participant.||Participants will meet with the PI or research assistant to complete the HAM-A and HAM-D17 at weeks 1, 3, and 5 at a designated location either in the researchers private practice office or university lab location. Adverse treatment reactions will also be noted. Treatment logs will also be collected at these points. At weeks 1 and 3, participants will be given fresh batteries, conductance solution, and felt tabs as needed. At the completion of the study, participants found to be in the shame treatment group will be offered the normal course of treatment. Participants not wanting to continue the study or do not wish to follow through with normal treatment after being in the shame group will be refunded their fee.||The hypothesis this study seeks to address is:||H°: There is no difference between sham treatment and active CES on level of anxiety as compared to scores on the HAM-A and HAM-D17.||H¹ : The active CES treatment group has significantly lower anxiety scores on the HAM-A and HAM-D17 than the sham group at the endpoint of the study.||Statistical analysis will compare baselines scores (week 1) to midpoint scores (week, 3), and scores at the endpoint of the study (week 5). Response to treatment will be defined as an improvement of 30% or greater on the HAM-A and HAM-D17 at the endpoint of the study. The impact of prescription medication as a confounding variable in relation to the effect of CES on anxiety and depression will also be examined. Data analysis will consist of a repeated measures design that will likely use a general linear model in SPSS and hierarchical linear and quadratic growth models to assess individual change. The reason for this approach is that hierarchical analysis of individual change is advantageous when there are multiple repeated measure data patterns because it affords the research an opportunity to combine into a single analysis (Raudenbush & Byrk, 2002). We will estimate both the individual growth and mean growth for each point in the time series. Cross-validation of quadratic will occur via the estimation of a piecewise linear growth models to assess whether growth is more variable for one period over another during the study time frame.||Optimal design software has been used to make a preliminary determination that 100 or more participants in a randomized quadratic growth individual change model will achieve a power of .80 to .95 for a study expecting an effect size of between 0.6 to .80, respectively (0.62 is premised upon meta-analysis for CES undertaken by Klawansky, et al., 1995 and .8 is considered a large effect by Cohen, 1988). We will employ power analysis again once sample size is confirmed following recruitment of participants and expect upwards of 150 or more participants. Missing data will be explained using an intent-to-treat analysis whereby we employ redundant analysis procedures (i.e., survival analysis) to understand and context the true treatment effect., Anxiety|Anxiety Disorders

2	RCT of tDCS Combined With Cognitive Training in Schizophrenia, The current study is a parallel-group, double-blinded, randomised controlled trial that aimed to fill the knowledge gap in investigating the effect of five sessions of concurrent cognitive training with 'online' tDCS on specific cognitive domains in stable schizophrenia patients at two time-points, (i) immediately after the intervention (ii) at one month after intervention.||It was hypothesized that concurrent cognitive training with 'online' tDCS would result in greater incremental effective improvements in cognitive domains as compared to the cognitive training alone, and the effect would be sustainable at one-month follow-up. The effect of the concurrent cognitive training with 'online' tDCS were also assessed using blinded assessments of psychotic, negative symptoms, affective symptoms, psychosocial functioning, subjective quality of life (QOL) and tolerability in the two groups.||Participant were randomly allocated to one of the two groups using a predetermined randomisation sequence and block randomisation generator (block of 6). Group 1 received active tDCS stimulation and CT and will be referred to as the active tDCS + CT group. Group 2 received sham tDCS and CT and will be referred to as the sham tDCS + CT group. Both groups consisted of 23 participants and received five treatment sessions on five consecutive days.||Stimulation protocol with the corresponding randomisation code was set up by an independent psychiatrist.The double-blind administration panel of the SatrStim8 system of tDCS ensured effective blinding; both the principal investigator and the participants were blinded to the group allocation until the statistical analysis stage.

2	Culturally Based Family Therapy for Improving Treatment Outcome for People With Schizophrenia, Schizophrenia is a disabling mental disorder that affects approximately 1% of the population worldwide. People with schizophrenia frequently experience hallucinations, delusions, disordered thinking, movement disorders, emotional numbness, social withdrawal, and cognitive deficits. These symptoms can hinder a person's ability to perform everyday functions, such as hold a job and maintain normal social relationships. When combined with medication, family-oriented therapy interventions have been beneficial for people with schizophrenia. There are few programs, however, that are tailored to the needs of minorities. With the rising number of minority populations in the U.S., it is important to develop psychotherapy interventions that are designed specifically for these groups. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of a culturally based family therapy intervention in improving treatment outcome in people with schizophrenia.||Participants in this 12-month, open label study will first attend a 2-hour screening visit, at which information will be gathered regarding coping styles, spirituality, and expressed emotion. Participants will then be randomly assigned to receive either culturally based therapy or treatment as usual. Although the culturally based therapy will be tailored to the needs and values of Hispanics, people who are not Hispanic will not be excluded. The culturally based therapy will entail 15 weekly therapy sessions, which will focus on family unity, psychoeducation, spirituality, communication skills, and problem-solving. The group receiving treatment as usual will attend 3 weekly psychoeducation sessions that will focus on informing participants about schizophrenia. Outcomes for both groups will be assessed upon completion of treatment and at follow-up visits at Months 6 and 12., Culture|Family|Therapy

2	"Sensorimotor Gating in Schizophrenia, Patients with schizophrenia have difficulty screening out irrelevant stimuli, and often have the experience of sensory flooding. These ""gating deficits"" may contribute to the thought disorder, cognitive fragmentation and hallucinations which are so debilitating to these individuals. The acoustic startle response is a reflex contraction of the skeletal muscles in response to a sudden acoustic stimulus. It occurs across mammalian species and can be easily measured. The modulation of this reflex by a preliminary nonstartling stimulus is termed prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle (PPI), a paradigm which is used as an operational measure of sensorimotor gating. In consonance with the schizophrenia symptoms that are suggestive of gating deficits, many patients with schizophrenia have deficits in PPI when compared to healthy controls. The brain regions that modulate PPI include the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, areas that are implicated as being abnormal in schizophrenia. Our prior work and work from other labs suggests that PPI impairment in schizophrenia does not improve with treatment and hence may be a trait related abnormality. Work from our current funding period supports our original hypothesis, namely that impaired PPI exhibits familial association. Specifically, we are finding that PPI in first degree family members of subjects with schizophrenia is impaired. Further work is needed in order to establish that PPI impairment is heritable.||An endophenotype is a measurable trait or phenotype detectable by a biological test. Using an endophenotype rather than presence or absence of disease is a powerful tool in the study of diseases with complex polygenic etiologies such as schizophrenia. Progress in the genetics of schizophrenia is greatly confounded by the difficulty in identifying individuals who carry genes contributing to schizophrenia. Incomplete penetrance and the fact that both heritable and environmental factors interact to produce the disease add to this difficulty. This means that some individuals carrying vulnerability genes for schizophrenia who fail to exhibit robust symptoms will be classified erroneously as unaffected in genetic studies, confounding attempts to reliably define the heritable phenotype. The phenomenon of incomplete penetrance is exhibited by the finding that the risk of schizophrenia is the same for children of affected and nonaffected monozygotic twins. The polygenic etiology of schizophrenia makes it unlikely that a pooled sample of individuals defined by the presence of schizophrenia will greatly overlap in the vulnerability genes that they carry. The goal of the endophenotype approach is to narrow the defined phenotype so that a more homogeneous genotype is expected, making it much more fruitful and to conduct genetic studies.||We hypothesize that impaired PPI will prove to be a heritable endophenotype in schizophrenia. Based on our work accomplished during the current funding period, we now propose to further develop this line of research by conducting a heritability analysis of PPI. Our field is greatly in need of this work as a prelude to endophenotype-based genetic studies. We will accomplish our important goal by collecting and characterizing a cohort of healthy controls and their families, and by expanding our sample of schizophrenia subjects and their families. We will collect diagnostic, symptom, cognitive, pedigree, and PPI data all subjects, and will collect blood and extract DNA for future genetic analyses. We will use a family based strategy to investigate the pattern and degree of heritability of impaired PPI in families of schizophrenia and control probands.||This project will provide the necessary next step in advancing the use of impaired PPI as a powerful tool for the discovery of vulnerability genes contributing to schizophrenia. Currently available treatments for this devastating disorder are sadly inadequate. Our medications are virtually ineffective for a subset of our patients. The discovery of vulnerability genes and of a method for biological subtyping of patients will allow our field to develop genetically informed new treatments that specifically target particular subtypes of patients. This approach is our best hope for bringing relief to patients suffering from this disease., Schizophrenia|Prepulse Inhibition|Acoustic Startle"

The literature research discloses that of few studies, most used sample sizes 10 subjects or less per experimental or control group and results have been mixed: Orne & Paskewitz (1974) and Watson & Herder (1980) found no significant effect sizes for anxiety symptom reduction and Egner, Strawson & Gruzelier (2002) did not find a significant difference in subjective activation level between alpha/theta (A/T) NFT and the sham group. On the other hand, Hardt & Kamiya (1978), Plotkin & Rice (1981), Sargunaraj, Kumaraiah, Mishra, & Kumar (1987), Rice, Blanchard & Purcell (1993), Vanathy, Sharma, & Kumar (1998), Sarkar, Rathee, & Neera (1999), Eismont Lutsyuk ,& Pavlenko (2011), and Gruzelier, Thompson, Redding, Brandt & Steffert (2013) did find a significant anxiety symptom reduction through NFT. The U.S. National Institutes of Health's National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) at this time does not endorse NFT as an efficacious treatment for anxiety problems.||General hypothesis: A ten-session NFT protocol of up-training alpha (8-11 Hz) and theta (5-7.5 Hz) frequency bands lowers the subjective experience of trait anxiety and elevates mean theta and lowers alpha amplitudes in EEG recordings for individuals with moderate to high trait anxiety (while individuals' subjective experience of trait anxiety and theta/alpha ratios in the sham NFT condition will not change).||Control for treatment expectations and self-efficacy||There will be no significant differences between the treatment and the sham group in treatment expectations / self efficacy as measured by the Stanford Expectations of Treatment Scale (SETS) and the Rotter Locus of Control Scale.||There will be no significant differences between the treatment and the sham treatment group pre-and post treatment satisfaction as measured by assessments as measured by the SETS modified outcome scale.||Treatment effect hypotheses:||The treatment group will on average:||show higher mean theta and higher alpha amplitudes within and between sessions than the sham group. (The mean theta/alpha ratios within a session will be calculated by adding the theta/alpha ratio of the beginning and end of the first 8-minute NFT block and the end of the second and third NFT block and dividing these four ratios by four).|have a higher mean linear increase of theta amplitude and higher linear decrease in Alpha between the NFT session than individuals from the sham group (→ learning curves).|feel subjectively more deactivated and calm (as assessed by Thayer's ActivationDeactivation Adjective Checklist (AD-ACL)) at the end of each session than the sham group.|feel subjectively more deactivated and calm the more sessions of NFT they have had while the sham group will not.|show more decreased self-rated anxiety symptoms (as measured by the the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and Generalized Anxiety Item Scale (GAD-7) than the sham group.|show a higher mean linear increase of theta amplitude and lower mean alpha amplitude within and across sessions will be correlated to a higher score in deactivation and relaxation in the treatment group but not in the sham group.|show a higher mean linear increase of theta amplitude and lower mean alpha amplitude across sessions will be correlated to a lower pre-post treatment score in the STAI, BAI, and GAD-7 inventories in the treatment group but not in the sham group, meaning=> a higher negative correlation between the STAI, BAI, and GAD-7 change scores and the mean linear increase of theta amplitude and lower mean alpha amplitude across sessions is to be expected in the treatment group than in the change group.|have a higher alpha and theta distribution on the mini-QEEG, particularly in the Pz region.||Adults with no prior NFT experience who scored moderate to high on the State Anxiety Inventory Questionnaires (STAI-Y; scores: >66%), low on the Beck Depression Questionnaire (BDI-II; scores: <19), who may or may not have been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, but have no other serious co-morbid mental health or neurological conditions, such as Major Depressive Disorder, Bipolar Disorder, Schizophrenia, Substance Use Disorder, epilepsy or tic disorders will be included in the study.||After pre-screening, participants will be assigned to the experimental or sham NFT conditions by randomized MATLAB protocol (seven random zero/one vectors of four integers length, equally made up of zeros and ones, to represent experimental (digit 1) and control group participants (digit 0)).||Experimental and sham group will be rewarded for uptraining the power of particular wave frequencies using auditory, visual, and number rewards. The two reward sounds (low pan flute sound and steel drum sounds) will be playing as sustained MIDI sounds with amplitude modulation and will depend on the power of the respective wave frequencies. The reward criterion will be set at 250ms with a refractory period of 200 ms between rewards. Participants will also be shown a flying dragon looped video (Vulcan flying) which becomes brighter in color when alpha and/or theta power is up as a visual reward and see their reward percentage as a number on the screen beside the looped video. Both groups will be trained in three segments of eight minutes of NFT with an up to 90s break (depending on the participants' preferences) between each of the segments.||The experimental A/T NFT group will receive ten sessions of A/T NFT - specifically up-training alpha (8-11 Hz, low pan flute sound) and theta (5-7 Hz, steel drum sound). The sham NFT group will receive ten sessions of two alternating NFT protocols. In odd-numbered sessions (1,3,5,7,9) lobeta (13-16 Hz pan flute sound) and hibeta (16-22 Hz, steel drum sound) will be uptrained and alpha (8-11 Hz), theta (5-7.5 Hz) and hibeta (23-30 Hz) are inhibited. In even numbered sessions (2,4,6,8,10) beta (13-16 Hz, pan flute sound) and hibeta (16-22 Hz, steel drum) are down-trained and alpha (8-11 Hz), theta (5-7.5 Hz) and hibeta (23-30 Hz) are inhibited.||The BrainAvatar® 4.0 suite (Brainmaster Technologies, Inc; http://www.brainmaster.com), will be used for all NFT. Pz will be selected as the EEG recording site, with A1 as the reference and A2 as the ground electrodes. The sampling rate will be set to the standard 256 Hz per second at a resolution of <0.01 Hz, and 10,000 amplification. Impedance will be set at < 10 kOhms. Filters used will be a band pass filter (80Hz high and 60 low pass) and an A/D low pass filter (allowing 0-30 Hz activity). Smoothing time will be 0.5s at 3 dB. The artifact rejection threshold will be set at 200 microV.||Statistical analysis:||The overall design of the proposed study calls for a mixed ANOVA Treatment condition (A/T vs. sham) serves as the between-subjects, and pre/post levels of anxiety, as the within-subjects factor. Treatment effectiveness (across both groups) would be reflected in a significant within-subjects effect and the efficacy of NFT specifically would be reflected in an interaction whereby significantly more improvement (i.e. lowered trait anxiety) would be found in the A/T in contrast to the Sham-Control condition. In a mixed analysis of this kind, a total of (N = 27) participants is required to detect moderate sized (f = .25) interaction effects and within-subjects effects with adequate power (.80).||Specifically:||ANOVAs||pre-and post-treatment (before & after 10 sessions of neurofeedback) mean theta/alpha ratios between sham and treatment group|pre-and post-session (10 sessions) mean theta/alpha ratios within individual & between sessions comparing sham & treatment group|pre-and post-session (10 sessions) Activation Deactivation Adjective Checklist (AD-ACL) scores within individual|pre-and post-session (10 sessions) AD-ACL scores between sessions|pre- and post treatment STAI anxiety scores between treatment and sham group|pre- and post treatment BAI anxiety scores between treatment and sham group|pre- and post treatment GAD-7 anxiety scores between treatment and sham group|pre-and post treatment mini-QEEG patterns between treatment and sham group||Correlations / regression analyses:||individual learning curves for A/T treatment condition over ten sessions: mean theta/alpha ratios for individuals between sessions|correlation between AD-ACL pre- and post treatment scores and theta/alpha ratio pre-and post treatment|correlation between SETS scores pre- and post treatment scores and theta/alpha ratio pre-and post treatment|correlation between STAI pre-and post treatment scores and theta/alpha ratio pre-and post treatment|correlation between BAI pre-and post treatment scores and theta/alpha pre-and post treatment scores|correlation between GAD-7 pre-and post treatment scores and theta/alpha pre-and post treatment scores|correlation between Rotter Locus of Control scores and theta/alpha ratio pre-and post treatment||Qualitative Analysis:||which mental strategies were used during the NFT training and as how effective different strategies were perceived at by the individual subjects|what specific changes (if any) in thoughts, feelings and behavior in everyday life the individual subjects perceived, trait anxiety|A/T neurofeedback|EEG biofeedback|randomized

2	CATIE- Schizophrenia Trial, This trial will consist of 1600 patients with schizophrenia for whom a medication change may be indicated for reasons of limited efficacy or tolerability. All patients will receive some psychosocial treatment through study participation. Research participants and their family members will be offered psychosocial interventions directed at improving patient and family understanding of the illness, decreasing the burden of illness in the family, maximizing treatment adherence, minimizing relapse, enhancing access to a range of community-based rehabilitative services and improving study retention.||Phase I: Patients will be randomly assigned to one of five treatment conditions for up to 18 months:||320 begin double-blind treatment with perphenazine (PER)|320 begin double-blind treatment with olanzapine (OLZ)|320 begin double-blind treatment with quetiapine (QUET)|320 begin double-blind treatment with risperidone (RIS)|220 begin double-blind treatment with ziprasidone (ZIP)||Phase IA: 100 patients screened and found to have tardive dyskinesia who would otherwise be eligible for the study will be randomly assigned to one of the four atypical drugs in Phase IA.||Phase IB: Patients who fail treatment with perphenazine in Phase I will be randomly assigned to olanzapine, quetiapine, or risperidone in Phase IB.||Phase II: Patients who discontinue their initial assigned atypical antipsychotic treatment in Phase I, IA, or IB for any non-administrative reason will proceed to their second assigned treatment (third for Phase IB patients) and will be followed for up to the remainder of their 18-month participation, as follows:||Patients originally assigned to one of the newer atypical antipsychotics who discontinue due to efficacy failure will be randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with one of the other two newer atypical antipsychotics (OLZ, RIS, QUET) which they had not previously received (50%) or with open label clozapine (50%).|Patients originally assigned to one of the newer atypical antipsychotics who discontinue due to tolerability failure will be randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with one of the other newer atypical antipsychotics (OLZ, RIS, QUET) which they had not previously received (50%), or with ziprasidone (50%). Until ziprasidone is activated, all patients will be assigned to one of the other atypical antipsychotics.||Phase II will last at least 6 months, even if that means participants stay in the study for more than 18 months||Phase III: Patients who discontinue Phase II will be recommended open treatment with the preferred regimen based on their treatment history in the study. The treatment options include clozapine, newer atypical antipsychotic (olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, ziprazidone, and aripiprazole), fluphenazine decanoate, perphenazine, and dual antipsychotic therapy using two of these drugs.||Note: All treatments will be double-blinded in treatment Phases I and II except for clozapine., Antipsychotic Treatment|Effectiveness

2	Study of m-RESIST, an m-Health Program for Treatment-resistant Schizophrenia, The main goal of the present study is to evaluate the acceptability, usability, and satisfaction to m-RESIST solution among the target groups (patients, caregivers, clinicians), and also to evaluate the effect of m-RESIST solution to empowerment and perceived quality of life of the treatment-resistant Schizophrenia patients (TRS). Interventions targeting key problems in TRS (risk behaviours, persistent symptoms of psychosis, poor medication adherence, unhealthy lifestyle habits) will be administered in a clinical setting, with the long-term goal of creating a widely-available system that can be deployed by users as needed, in their own environments.||The study will be conducted in three different regions: Gertner (Israel), Semmelweis (Hungary) and Barcelona (Spain). Consequently, the outcomes obtained in each site and their comparison will allow improving the m-RESIST program in terms of interoperability, integration of components and final implementation of the interactive system in the healthcare pathways.||The participants will be selected from Sheba Medical Center - Psychiatric Division (Tel Aviv), Semmelweis University - Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy (Budapest), and the adult psychiatric outpatient service of Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau (Barcelona).||A total of 45 patients with TRS (15 per centre), with their caregiver, will be included in the trial. All participants will be fully informed about the nature of the study (aims, methodology) and the system tested (data protection, expected risks/benefits, possible adverse events) and they will sign the informed consent for their participation in this study., telemedicine
1	Interventions for Communication in Autism Network, While significant progress has been made toward identifying effective interventions for preschool-age children with autism (National Research Council, 2001), few scientifically rigorous studies have compared active ingredients of these interventions or examined outcomes focused on core deficits. To address these areas of need, this collaborative, multi-site project combines the expertise of investigators experienced in randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs), in the study of core deficits in young children with autism, and in data management and analysis of multi-site clinical trials.||The goal of this project is to compare the efficacy of two interventions for improving spoken language and reducing symptoms of autism: (1) Discrete trial training (DTT)--an applied behavior analysis approach emphasizing highly structured teaching of school readiness skills (match-to-sample, imitation, functional play, and receptive and expressive language) and (2) Interpersonal developmental approach (IDA): a visually supported, child-focused, flexible engagement, social communicative engagement approach on joint attention, symbolic play, and the use of conventional symbols within socially valid communicative contexts.||Children will be randomly assigned to DTT or IDA. In each condition, children's ongoing early intervention programs will be augmented with two 30-minute sessions daily of the study intervention (DTT or IDA) conducted by supervised therapists for 4 months, with transition to home therapy for 2 months.||Potential moderators (e.g., initial mental age and language age) and mediators (e.g. parent synchronization of joint attention and changes in parental expectancies) on treatment outcome will also be examined.||The assessment measures will include diagnostic and developmental measures. There are three sets of assessments. The first set of assessments is to determine whether the child is eligible for the study. If the child is eligible, we will complete the next set of assessments, which are completed at three points: (1) prior to entry into the treatment (this is a baseline measurement conducted just before the start of the treatment phase); (2) at exit; and (3) at a 6 month follow-up. Several assessments will also be completed after 2 months, 4 months, and 6 months., 0
2	Cognitive Remediation for Schizophrenia, Schizophrenia leads to a striking array of negative outcomes, including profound deficits in the ability to fulfill desired and expected community roles. Chronic under employment and unemployment are among the most serious of these consequences. VA treats over 100,000 veterans with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, the majority of whom are unable to work competitively and do not participate in VA vocational rehabilitation programs despite the fact that VA is committed to enhancing the ability of these veterans to work. Within VA, a major vehicle for helping veterans to become employed is the Compensated Work Therapy (CWT) program, yet in FY2001 only 800 of the roughly 14000 veterans treated in CWT had SMI diagnoses, and only a subset of those 800 had schizophrenia. A number of factors contribute to low participation in vocational rehabilitation and poor work outcomes, but recent data suggest that one of the most important is cognitive impairment. People with schizophrenia have significant deficits in multiple areas of neurocognition, including secondary and working memory, attention, and executive functioning. These impairments have been shown to play a major role in functional outcome, including the ability to benefit from rehabilitation and to work. As a result, there has been increasing interest in the potential for improving neurocognitive functioning via cognitive rehabilitation. While several programs have yielded promising data, currently there is no empirically validated approach.The purpose of this project is to evaluate the efficacy of an innovative, computer driven cognitive rehabilitation program we have developed: Computer Assisted Cognitive Remediation (CACR). Veterans with schizophrenia who are unemployed and not participating in vocational rehabilitation will be recruited and randomly assigned to one of two conditions: a) 36 sessions of CACR; or b) 36 sessions of a manualized computer control condition (RC). The efficacy of CACR will be assessed on a range of outcome domains, including neuropsychological test, measures of every day and social problem solving, self-reported cognitive functioning and self-efficacy, and work readiness. All subjects will be referred to CWT at the conclusion of treatment and we will assess how many receive work assignments, and work performance (over 3-months) of those who begin work. We hypothesize that CACR will be more effective than the control treatment in each domain.The results of this project could have important implications for treatment of veterans with schizophrenia. CACR is a manualized program that can be administered by BA level staff. If demonstrated to be efficacious, it could be disseminated throughout VA and have a beneficial impact on vocational outcomes and the quality of life of veterans with schizophrenia., cognition|schizophrenia|treatment

2	Disturbance of Plasma Cytokine Parameters in Clozapine-Resistant Treatment-Refractory Schizophrenia (CTRS) and Their Association With Combination Therapy, Schizophrenia is one of the most serious mental illnesses worldwide that affects approximately 1% of the worldwide population and result in a heavy economic burden to affected family. Antipsychotics are the main stay of treatment of schizophrenia, however, there are still approximately 1/3 schizophrenia patients who does not responded to the antipsychotic agents, and these patients easily develop into treatment-refractory schizophrenia (TRS).||Clozapine is the only evidence based effective medication for treatment-refractory schizophrenia (TRS). In spite of its prominent efficacy, approximately 1/3-2/1 treatment-refractory schizophrenia (TRS) treated with clozapine still present with significant residual psychotic symptoms and negative symptoms. As such, over time, clinicians struggled to find strategies to improve outcome by augmenting the concomitant psychiatric treatments, including not only combining antipsychotics but also combining a mood stabilizer or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).||Clozapine is an antipsychotic drug with multi receptor blocking effect and has a low affinity for dopamine D2. Studies of traditional antipsychotics have suggested that maximal efficacy occurs with dopamine D2 occupancy of 70% or more, while clozapine's dopamine D2 occupancy levels less than 60%. Amisulpride has a highly selective blocking effect on dopamine D2 and dopamine D3 receptors and has no affinity for any other known receptors. Its unique dopamine receptor blocking effect may selectively enhances the limited dopamine D2 blocking effect of clozapine, making it possible to be a suitable and effective drug for combination with clozapine. A number of promising studies that have augmented clozapine with amisulpride, have shown psychiatric symptoms improvement in TRS versus those on clozapine alone.||Both electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and antiepileptic drugs, such as sodium valproate, shares anticonvulsant properties and anticonvulsant effect relate to clinical efficacy. In 1983, Sackeim et al. pointed out that electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)-induced cortical gamma-aminobutyric-acid (GABA) depletion may be the reason for its anticonvulsant action. In addition, the effect of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) on the gamma-aminobutyric-acid (GABA) system was confirmed by several studies. Interestingly, it has been reported that the therapeutic effect of sodium valproate combined with antipsychotics is closely related to gamma-aminobutyric-acid (GABA) system.||Growing evidence suggests that the immune, endocrine, and nervous systems interact with each other through cytokines, hormones, and neurotransmitters. The activation of the immune system may be involved in the neuropathological changes occurring in the central nervous system. Among several components of immune pathogenesis, aberrant cytokine signaling is considered as one of the key contributors. Many cytokines have been speculated to be involved in the pathological process of schizophrenia. IL-2 acts as a growth factor for T cells, NK cells and B cells, abnormalities of IL-2 serum levels or its production were found in acute schizophrenia cases. IL-6 is an inflammatory cytokine, which plays significant role in neurobiological functions like neuronal differentiation and survival, synaptic transmission and brain morphometry. The abnormal expression of IL-6 can be found in both first-episode and chronic schizophrenia. TNF-α is one of the most important pro-inflammatory cytokines, which expressed mainly by macrophages. Previous studies have found that the expression of TNF-α is abnormal in patients with schizophrenia.||The primary objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety between sodium valproate, amisulpride and MECT combination therapy in clozapine-treated refractory schizophrenia during a 12 weeks period. In addition, the effect of combined therapy on plasma cytokines (IL-2, IL-6 and TNF-α) will be evaluated., Schizophrenia， clozapine， amisulpride, valproate， ECT, cytokine

These patients will be compared to 30 patients who are not clinically anxious. Of these 60 anxious patients, 30 will be randomly assigned to a 4-week course of breathing training assisted by feedback of end-tidal pCO2 levels as an augmentation of their current treatment. They will be compared to 30 who simply will continue with their current treatment (TAU). The breathing training group will receive clinical and physiological assessments immediately before the treatment period, four weeks after the end of the treatment period, and at a 4-month follow-up. The TAU group will be assessed three times at equivalent intervals, and if they wish, may undergo breathing training after the third assessment. Treatment will take place mainly in the first two years, giving us adequate time for follow-up and data analysis. We expect that this therapy will be especially effective for treating anxiety in the patients with substantial respiratory dysregulation., Anxiety|Breathing Training|Respiratory Dysregulation

2	Study of add-on Ramelteon Therapy on Sleep and Circadian Rhythm Disruption in Patients With Schizophrenia, Schizophrenia is a mental dysfunction of thought, perception and behaviour which can be attributed to complex and dynamically interacting perturbations in multiple neurochemical systems. Along with these cardinal features of schizophrenia, sleep disorders and disturbed circadian rhythm are commonly encountered among patients. Markedly decreased sleep efficiency, delayed sleep onset and frequent awakenings are most common observations. Endogenous melatonin is a dependable biomarker of circadian rhythmicity and, it has already been found that the nocturnal rise of endogenous melatonin is blunted leading to circadian dysrhythmia in schizophrenia.||The antipsychotics prescribed for the condition though cause improvement in the cardinal symptoms of the disease but have no significant effect on melatonin levels. The blunted peak of night time melatonin secretion are not restored or even decreased even after several months therapy with antipsychotics. In this clinical scenario, add-on therapy with sedative/ hypnotics along with antipsychotics is mandate for a prescription. Previous studies revealed that add-on therapy with benzodiazepines can worsen the already existing derangement in circadian rhythm by decreasing secretion of nocturnal melatonin. A long term add on therapy with benzodiazepines in patients on antipsychotics has been found to have an increased risk of death.||Addition of melatonin to the pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia elevates mood and daytime functioning in addition to improved sleep in schizophrenia patients. Melatonin, apart from being a hypnotic and circadian rhythm restoring compound, also possess neuroprotective, anti-neuroinflammatory and antioxidant properties. The rate limiting step of melatonin biosynthetic pathway is the alkylation of serotonin to N- acetyl serotonin, catalyzed by enzyme AANAT (aryl-alkylamine- N-acetyl-transferase). Study of AANAT enzyme and its modulation to achieve normal rhythmical secretion of melatonin can also be a potential target for resynchronising the circadian rhythm.||Ramelteon is a melatonin receptor agonist approved for treatment of insomnia by the USFDA. It exerts its action by acting on MT1 and MT2 receptors at suprachiasmatic nucleus. The long term safety of ramelteon has been evaluated by several workers and found no significant adverse effects like abuse liability, rebound insomnia and cognitive impairment. In contrast to melatonin, it shows higher-binding affinity for MT1 and MT2 receptors, more lipophilic and has a longer half-life(t1/2 of melatonin is 20-50 min whereas that of ramelteon is 1-2.6 hrs and that of its active melabolite M-II is 2-5 hrs). In addition, ramelteon has been already evaluated as a potential adjunctive treatment for learning and memory deficits in schizophrenia.||The sleep and circadian rhythm disorders in schizophrenia have so far been given very less importance by researchers and there are limited studies targeting or modulating the melatonin pathway. Therefore, proposed study has been planned to evaluate the effect of add-on ramelteon on sleep pattern/quality and circadian rhythm disruption in patients with schizophrenia., 0
2	An Efficacy, Safety And Tolerability Study of Flexibly Dosed Paliperidone Extended Release (ER) in Participants With Schizophrenia, This is a non-randomized (the study drug is not assigned by chance), single arm, multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study) 6-month study. Participants can be transitioned to an effective dose of paliperidone ER from any oral antipsychotic medication due to lack of efficacy, lack of tolerability or safety, lack of compliance or other reason. A transition period of maximum 4 weeks will be allowed. Throughout the study, participants will receive flexible dose of 3 to 12 milligram (mg) of paliperidone once daily orally for 6 months. Adjustment of the dosage will be done at Investigator's discretion, based on the individual participant's clinical response and tolerability of the study drug dosages. Participants who complete this 6-month study and would like to continue will be eligible to be enrolled in an extension phase until paliperidone ER is available. The starting dose of the extension phase will be the same as at the end of the 6-month study and may be changed throughout the extension period. The extension phase will consist of a main extension phase (ending with an End of Main Extension Phase Visit) and a modified extension phase (ending with an End of Study Visit). Efficacy will primarily be evaluated by positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS). Safety will primarily be evaluated by Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS)., Schizophrenia|Flexible dosing|Non-acute patients|Antipsychotic|Atypical|INVEGA

1	Therapeutic Intervention Effects of rTMS on Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder, Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common and complex neurodevelopmental disorder, which is characterized by impairments of social communication, social reciprocity, as well as restricted and repetitive behaviors (RRB). The unclear pathogenesis of ASD, its increasing prevalence, and its poor clinical diagnosis and treatment effect have caused a serious economic and mental burden on patients and their families. As a new non-invasive neuroelectrophysiological technique, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been used more and more in the interventional treatment of autism. The current project aims to explore the influence of TMS on brain plasticity in autism by using TMS for interventional treatment of autism and provide guidelines for the intervention and treatment of autism by evaluating the efficiency of these methods. Investigators conduct a randomized, double-blind, controlled TMS trial and collect the participants' stool samples and sequence the gut microbiome before the first magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) scan.

2	Cognitive Remediation Program for Hospitalized in the Long Term Patients With Deficit Schizophrenia, Schizophrenia is a chronic disease with deficit in social interaction and lost of autonomy in daily life. Negative symptoms as blunted affect, avolition, social deficit and anhedonia and cognition were prognosis and functioning key's factors. Psychotropic medications have shown only poor effect to improve negative symptoms and cognition as attention, memory and cognitive flexibility. So, cognitive remediation programs were developped to focus cognitive disorders. The IPT (Integrated Psychological Treatment) is one of the most complete program with modules on cognitive and social abilities. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of IPT+ program to improve autonomy capacities of long stay inpatients suffering from schizophrenia 6 at the end of the program The secondary objectives are to evaluate autonomy 6 months after the program, to evaluate the efficacy of the program on negative symptoms, quality of life, cognitive functions, social cognition and duration of hospitalisation.||This study propose a randomised controlled study with 2 arms, with blind evaluation to compare the IPT+ versus treatment as usual (TAU). The follow up will be 6 month for the With IPT+ this study will improve autonomy capacities for patients suffering from deficit schizophrenia and allowed patients to go out hospital earlier than before., Deficit Schizophrenia|long stay inpatients|cognitive remediation|negative symptoms
2	An Exploratory Study on the Safety and Effectiveness of Paliperidone in Patients With Schizophrenia, Paliperidone is an extended-release tablet. Paliperidone is an active metabolite of risperidone, not approved for the treatment of schizophrenia in Japan. This is a multicenter, open-label, parallel-group, fixed dose study to evaluate the safety, effectiveness, and plasma concentration of paliperidone taken once daily in patients with schizophrenia. The patients will receive a fixed dose of paliperidone (3, 9, and 15 mg) for 6 weeks and its effectiveness and safety will be observed for an additional 2 weeks.. Efficacy will be measured by determining changes throughout the study in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) score, a scale for the measurement of symptoms of schizophrenia, and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) score. In addition, the study also assesses the relationship between dose/plasma drug concentration and dopamine D2 receptor occupancy in patients who consent to receive positron emission tomography (PET). Safety evaluations (symptoms, physical exams, electrocardiograms, laboratory tests, Drug-Induced Extrapyramidal Symptoms Scale [DIESS] results, and adverse event monitoring) will be conducted throughout the study. The study hypothesis is that paliperidone will be effective in the treatment of schizophrenia, and that it will be well-tolerated. The patients will receive either 3, 9, or 15 mg of paliperidone, taken once daily by mouth for 6 weeks., Schizophrenia|Risperidone|Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)|Clinical Global Impression (CGI)|Positron Emission Tomography (PET)

The control group consisted of participants who informed verbally about the surgical procedure and the potential postoperative complications,. Also, a written informed consent document was given. Participants in the study group were asked to watch a video which was previously uploaded to the internet and was showed procedural details of an impacted right lower third molar extraction (with permission and written consent). Participants in the study group were also informed verbally about the surgical procedure-possible postoperative complications and was given with a written informed consent document. In both groups questions of the participants were answered by the same surgeon. To evaluate anxiety; participants were asked to complete 3 questionnaires one week before the procedure when taking appointment for surgery, just after watching video or informed verbally, immediately after the procedure and one week after the procedure., 0
0	Manual Acupuncture Using Acupuncture Needle vs Press Needle for COVID-19 Healthcare Anxiety, This study wanted to know would press needle be having better outcome for anxiety treatment, compared with filiform needles, because press needle taken home and could be manipulated as needed at home, unlike filiform needle where an acupuncturist must be available to do the treatment. Furthermore, the press needle needed to be changed once within 5 days, that is 2-3 times in week. So we hope to have better acupuncture option (in effectivity and timewise) for COVID healthcare workers anxiety treatment. There are no study to compare the usage of the two types of needles for anxiety treatment to date., acupuncture|press needle|anxiety
2	High-Definition Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation as a Treatment of Negative Symptoms of Schizophrenia, Schizophrenia is one of the most disabling psychiatric disorders that almost 1% worldwide population suffer from this devastating illness. The clinical expression of this illness has been categorized into different dimensions, though most of the patients are well treated with antipsychotic medication, the negative symptom is still one of the very refractory symptoms. Emerging evidence shows that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a promising treatment for schizophrenia negative symptoms, however, findings are still controversial. HD-tDCS can provide a more stable and accurate direct current comparing with traditional tDCS, which gives a hope to treat negative symptoms in a more reliable way.||An association between negative symptoms and grey matter reductions in the prefrontal cortex is found, moreover, even during rest, hypoactivity of the prefrontal cortex, particularly of the left dorsolateral, and of the anterior cingulate regions, has been linked to negative symptoms of schizophrenia. It has been observed that tDCS could relatively alleviate negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia by stimulating the left DLPFC through an anodal electrode, which has been proved can also modulate brain functional connectivity and have clinical improvements.||Half of the participants with a clinical presentation of predominant negative symptoms will be stimulated by active HD-tDCS and the rest will have a sham stimulation. HD-tDCS is going to be delivered at 1.5 mA intensity for 20 minutes once a day; sessions will be performed on 10 days 5 consecutive weekdays with sustained effects at 1 (T2) and 3 (T3) months. A Soterix Medical 4x1 HD-tDCS will be used with the anode placed over the left DLPFC (F3), surrounded by four cathodal electrodes at F5, F1, FC3 and AF3, based on the 10/20 international EEG system. All the outcomes will be assessed at baseline (T0, before HD-tDCS sessions), one day after the 10th HD-tDCS sessions (T1), and also at T2 and T3. Both participants and investigators will be blind to this treatment., schizophrenia|HD-tDCS|negative symptoms

2	Medial-prefrontal Enhancement During Schizophrenia Systems Imaging, This longitudinal mechanistic randomized controlled trial in patients with schizophrenia (SZ) and matched healthy controls (HC) examines the underlying cause of self-agency deficits in SZ and their responsiveness to navigated repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (nrTMS) of the medial prefrontal cortex. Using a multimodal neuroimaging approach that combines structural MRI with functional magnetoencephalography imaging (MEGI) and nrTMS that is integrated with cognitive and clinical assessments, this research provides an unprecedented rigorous assessment of the neural and cognitive basis of self-agency and its modulation by nrTMS, using two distinct and validated paradigms involving speech monitoring (pitch perturbation) and reality monitoring.||Subjects will first be assessed for 1 week for diagnostic inclusion criteria and eligibility assessment. They will complete baseline assessments (i.e., cognitive, clinical and daily functioning assessments, structural MRI, and MEGI scans while they perform reality and speech monitoring tasks). After baseline assessments, 80 SZ and 80 age, gender, and education-matched HC will be randomly assigned to either active 10Hz nrTMS targeting mPFC (40HC and 40SZ) or nrTMS targeting a control posterior parietal site (40HC and 40SZ). For the parietal site, the investigators will use the same TMS protocol parameters as the active nrTMS condition. Between and within group analyses will utilize repeated measures mixed-effects models to examine durability and generalizability of behavioral, cognitive, clinical and whole-brain neural oscillatory network changes (with focus on mPFC) after neuromodulation by active nrTMS at proximal, and distal post-nrTMS time-points, compared to control nrTMS of parietal site and baseline. Whole-brain correlations will be computed between neural activity (e.g., with focus on mPFC) related to self-agency during reality and speech monitoring tasks and behavior (e.g., self-generated retrieval accuracy and corrective response magnitude), and between neural activity with cognition, clinical symptoms and daily functioning)., Schizophrenia|Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation|Prefrontal Cortex|Self-Agency|Reality Monitoring
0	Effect of Biofeedback Training to Reduce Anxiety, Study Design:||This study will be conducted as a randomized control trial using subjects from one nursing school. Study subjects meeting the eligibility criteria will be randomized into two groups; the Biofeedback training group receiving EMG, RESP, and TEMP Biofeedback Training, and the Control group in which subjects will be asked to take three 20-minute writing sessions and write about the given control topic about their daily events of the past week. All the study subjects providing the consent to participate will be made to complete the study questionnaires (Demographic, Screening for Anxiety using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory -STAI6, 7) at baseline and at post-intervention (after 4 weeks).||Study participants will be recruited from the School of Nursing, Koohi Goth Women Hospital, Karachi-Pakistan. Our targeted population will be students from diverse ethnicity and will be considered eligible for participation if they indicated to have anxiety in the pre-screening using the anxiety scale. Students will be invited to take part in the study through advertisement representation on the notice board of the institute. Written informed consent will be obtained from each enrolled subject after providing detail regarding the objectives, duration, and purpose of the study.||Interventions:||The experimental intervention (EMG, RESP, and TEMP Biofeedback):||For this study, we will be using the Alive Pioneer with the GP8 Amp. GP8 Amp can record ECG Heart Rate, EMG for muscle tension, Hand Temperature and Skin conductance. Subjects in this group will get EMG, RESP, and TEMP biofeedback intervention training.||Electromyography Biofeedback (EMG) The surface EMG disposable sticky sensors will be attached to the bicep or flexor muscle. The ground sensor will be attached to subjects' fingertips to read the heart rate. A conductive paste, such as Ten20 Conductive Paste, can be used to improve the connection on hairy areas. The electrodes can be placed one right after another. Attach the white, black, and green lines from the GP8 Amp to the disposable electrodes, in order to see the EMG signals.||Respiration Biofeedback (RESP) In this training the GP8 Amp Reparation belt will be used. The Respiration Belt is placed around the abdomen or chest to measure the subject breathing. As the subject breathe, the belt stretches slightly, and this stretch (near the middle of the belt) is measured. The respiration data is shown as a yellow line in the breath pacer area in the Alive Bottom Graphs. The yellow respiration line shows how the subject breathing affects his/her heart rate and smoothness.||Temperature Biofeedback (TEMP) As suggested that temperature in the hand increases when one get relax. Using GP8 Amp, we can teach the subjects to increase their hand temperature dramatically. The temperature sensor is attached to the GP8 Amp in the mini-USB slot nearest the 4 leads. The other end of temperature sensor will be placed in the subject finger, using one of the skin conductance Velcro finger straps to hold the temperature sensor in place. It will take 30 seconds to 1 minute for temperature to calibrate, until the temperature measured stops increasing, then the training begins.||The sequence of the biofeedback training sessions is given below:||The training consists of a total of 8 sessions for every individual with 2 sessions per week over the duration of 4 weeks.|Each session will be approximately of 1 to 1.30 hour.|Subjects will be given clear instructions to not to use chocolate, coffee, tea and cocoa drinks at least 3 hours before the training session.|Since it is suggested that Anxiety tends to change with time so we might consider a one-month pretreatment measure as well as a just before treatment measure. That way we can be sure if our baseline is stable or not.|Baseline session: Subject will be asked to sit quietly for 15 minutes and their breathing rate, skin temperature and muscle tension using EMG will be measure without giving any intervention.|Subjects will then be given biofeedback training gradually to control their breathing rate, relaxed their muscle activity and temperature through RESP biofeedback, assisted EMG biofeedback and TEMP biofeedback, from the 1st session till their 8th Session.||The control intervention:||In control intervention, the subjects will be asked to take three 20-minute writing sessions and write about the given control topic about their daily events of the past week. For example, in Session 1, we may ask the Subjects to write about how they will use their time. Similarly, we will ask the subject to give more detail and write briefly about the given control condition in session 2 and session 3. At the end of three writing session, we will measure their EMG, RESP and TEMP to compare with the Biofeedback training group.||At the end of biofeedback training and writing sessions, the participants of both groups will also be asked to again fill the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory -STAI scale., Biofeedback Training|Anxiety|Nursing Students|EMG|Respiration|Temperature
2	Risperidone Maintenance Treatment in Schizophrenia, Prevention of relapse is the crucial task in the maintenance treatment of schizophrenia. This study set out to determine the duration of maintenance treatment with therapeutic risperidone dose in schizophrenia. In a multi-center, open label, randomized, controlled study design, patients with schizophrenia who were clinically stabilized following an acute episode were randomly assigned to a 'maintenance group' (optimal therapeutic doses continued for at least 1 year), a 4-week group (optimal therapeutic doses continued for 4 weeks followed by a 50% dose reduction that was maintained for at least 11 months) or a 26-week group (optimal therapeutic doses continued for 26 weeks followed by a 50% dose reduction for at least another 6 months)., Schizophrenia|Risperidone|Maintenance treatment|Relapse

Cognitive function will be evaluated using the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia. The participants' clinical symptoms and daily activities will be assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and Personal and Social Performance Scale.|For the healthy control subjects, psychiatric diagnoses will be verified using MINI, and blood samples will be obtained once to measure neuroendocrine and metabolite marker levels., biomarker|neuroendocrine|metabolite|cognitive functioning|clinical symptoms|schizophrenia
1	Effectiveness of Atomoxetine in Treating ADHD Symptoms in Children and Adolescents With Autism, Autism is a developmental disorder that can cause severe and pervasive impairment in thinking, feeling, language, and the ability to relate to others. It is usually first diagnosed in early childhood. Children with autism demonstrate repetitive behaviors or interests and deficits in social interaction, verbal communication, and nonverbal communication. In addition, they often have unusual responses to sensory experiences, such as certain sounds or the way objects look. Some symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), such as inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, are also associated with autism. Atomoxetine is a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that is used to treat ADHD. It works differently, however, than stimulant drugs and may help to reduce ADHD symptoms in children with autism. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of atomoxetine in treating children with ADHD symptoms associated with autism.||Potential participants will first attend a screening visit, which will include a psychiatric diagnostic interview, a practice session for swallowing pill capsules, a physical exam, an electrocardiogram (ECG), a blood test, and an assessment of pubertal stage. Females of childbearing age will also undergo a urine pregnancy test. In an initial double-blind study phase, eligible participants will be randomly assigned to receive either atomoxetine or placebo for 8 weeks. A baseline visit will include several rating scales, observations, and an interview to assess adaptive functioning. These measures and procedures will be used to keep track of symptoms, side effects, and behavior that could change during the study. Children who are assigned to placebo and do not notice an improvement in their ADHD symptoms will be given the opportunity to receive atomoxetine at the end of 8 weeks. Study visits will occur once a week for 4 weeks, and then every other week for the remainder of the 8 weeks. During these visits, many of the baseline questionnaires and interviews will be repeated. At the Week 8 visit, the physical exam, ECG, blood tests, and some baseline questionnaires will also be repeated. All children who respond well to atomoxetine may continue taking the drug for an additional 10 months. During this time, participants will report to the clinic once a month for the first 4 months, then once at the end of 7 months, and finally once at the end of 10 months. The same measures and procedures that were done during the 8-week phase will be done during the 10-month phase of this study., Autistic Disorder|Autism Spectrum Disorder

The study consists of a 1-week stabilization phase, followed by 12 weeks of treatment. The total trial duration is 13 weeks.|Assessment Procedures:||2.1. Primary Outcome Variable-psychopathology: Assessment instruments include the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) and the Clinical Global Impression (ICG). Patients are interviewed at screening, at week-4, at week-1, at baseline and at every two weeks, for a total of 12 ratings.||2.2. Cognitive tests: A comprehensive battery of tests encompassing the cognitive domains of executive function, attention, memory, perception, and general intellect is administered twice at baseline and at the end of 16-week treatment by a trained psychologist. Scoring follows standardized procedures. The Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) is administered as a measure of executive function. The N-back (0-3 back) test is administered as a measure of working memory. Logical Memory I and II, Verbal Paired Associates I and II, Visual Reproduction I and II and Digits Forward from the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R) are administered as a tests of episodic memory. The Distractibility version of Gordon Continuous Performance Test (CPT)is administered as a test of attention. A four-subtest version of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R), consisting of the Arithmetic, Similarities, Picture Completion, and Digit Symbol Substitution tests is administered to obtain an estimate of current Full- Scale Intelligence Quotient (FSIQ).||2.3. Social functioning: The Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP) examines the four dimensions of social functioning: Socially useful activities including work and study, personal and social relationships, self-care, disturbing and aggressive behaviors.||2.4. Side Effects: Parkinsonism is rated with the Simpson-Angus Scale for extrapyramidal side effects (SAS). The Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) is chosen to assess tardive dyskinesia (TD) severity.

2	Enhancing Prefrontal Oscillations and Working Memory in Early-course Schizophrenia, The overarching goal of this proposal is to establish whether, by acutely enhancing dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) oscillatory deficits experimentally, there is a corresponding improvement in working memory (WM) function in early-course schizophrenia (EC-SCZ) patients. To achieve this goal, the investigators will perform TMS/EEG assessments of DLPFC and related oscillatory parameters and evaluate WM ability with the AX-Continuous Performance Task (AX-CPT) before and after two theta burst stimulation (TBS) sessions (intermittent (iTBS) and sham TBS of DLPFC) in 75 EC-SCZ patients.||Aim 1. Establish the acute effects of active vs. sham TBS on DLPFC oscillatory activity/NF of EC-SCZ patients. The investigators will iTBS to enhance DLPFC oscillatory activity/NF, as assessed with TMS/EEG, in EC-SCZ patients.||H1: TBS condition (active vs sham) will moderate the change in DLPFC oscillatory activity/NF from pre to post-TBS, such that DLPFC oscillatory activity/NF will increase following iTBS (but not sham).||Aim 2. Assess the impact of acute active vs. sham TBS on WM performance in EC-SCZ patients. The investigators will assess the acute impact of active vs. sham iTBS on WM performance in EC-SCZ patients.||H2: iTBS condition (active vs sham) will moderate the change in WM from pre- to post-TBS, such that AX-CPT performance will improve following iTBS (but not sham).||Aim 3. Examine the relationship between TBS-related changes in DLPFC oscillatory activity/NF and WM performance in EC-SCZ patients.||H3: iTBS-induced increase in DLPFC oscillatory activity/NF will predict better post-iTBS WM performance in EC-SCZ patients., 0

0	Effectivness of Distraction by Electric ride-on Cars for Peri Operative Anxiety in Ambulatory Pediatric Surgery, Peri operative anxiety is one of major issues of pediatric anesthesia. Our efforts to decrease children anxiety improve pain, agitation ans behavioral changes during post operative period. Guidelines in pediatric anesthesia are to take into account anxiety in order to enhance recovery after anesthesia and to develop ambulatory surgery.||Pharmacological and non pharmacological tools are used. Midazolam is a benzodiazepin widely used but its indesirable effects such as paradoxical reactions, prolonged sedation and adverse behavioral changes are a brake to enhance recovery after anesthesia programs. Non pharmacological procedures are more promising (parental presence, behavioral preparation programs and distraction) but their etablishment is time consuming, requiring teaching programs, and changing habits. To our knowledge, distraction with ride-on car has not been studied yet.||Little electric car can carry children aged 2 years and more, it can be driven by children under adult distant command. Weight is limited to 35 kg (x pounds). Our hospital has 3 differents car models which allow children to choose for their prefered one et to become part of the adventure. Parental separation could be favored by this device.||Surgical procedures are ophtalmologic and oto rhino laryngologic, in an ambulatory ward receiving children ASA 1 to 3. Anesthesic procedure is the same for every child, inhalatory induction with sevoflurane following by perfusion for morphinic administration and oral intubation. To note, premedication is avoided and replaced by important information and reinsurrance of parents.||Chlidren will be randomised by block every week to go to operating room using gurney (goup a) or ride-on electric car (group b). Primary outcome is peri operative pediatric anxiety measured by Yale validated scale (m-YPAS). Other outcomes concern post opérative period (anxiety, pain, agitation), parental lived and satisfaction.||PTIBOLID is a monocentric prospective randomised controlled open study wich will include 110 patients in hopital Nord, Marseille, AP-HM., 0
1	"Study of Peer Relationships at School, Once families have decided to join the study, and have completed the informed consent process using the ""Social Skills Club - Parent Consent"", and once we obtain letters of agreement from participating elementary schools, children with ASD will be randomly assigned to one of two intervention conditions, SKILLS or ENGAGE, led by two trained doctoral students. Since children will be randomized to either the SKILLS or the ENGAGE group, we are hoping to determine the active ingredients for successfully integrating children with autism. For both the SKILLS and the ENGAGE groups, all interventions and observations of children will take place in the target child's school. Thus, upon admission to the project, research personnel will attend the participant's classroom at school, and distribute consent forms titled ""Peer Relationships at School - Classroom Parent Consent"" to all children in the class. The consenting process should be no more than ten minutes. For those children that return informed consent from their parents, as well as offer assent on the ""Children's Classroom Assent"" to join to the project, social network measures (including brief demographic information), as well as friendship surveys (Friendships Qualities Scale; FQS), and an emotion measure (loneliness questionnaire) will be distributed at pre-intervention (baseline), post-intervention, and follow-up time points. These measures will take approximately 30-40 minutes per each time point. Graduate students will administer the measures and will make every effort to do so at a convenient time for the teacher and for the classroom to avoid utilizing instructional time. In addition, the efficacy of the treatment interventions will be assessed with ongoing direct behavioral observations at entry, twice during treatment, at exit, and at the 2-month follow-up., social networks|friendships|autism spectrum disorder"

1	Joint Attention Intervention and Young Children With Autism, Young children with autism experience severe deficit in joint attention skills (e.g. pointing to objects, showing, following another person's gaze, responding to invitations to social interaction). Ability to initiate and respond to joint attention is linked to children's later language abilities. As a mean to improve language outcome in children with autism, it is important to target joint attention in early intervention programs.||This study investigates the effectiveness of a joint attention intervention. Sixty 2-4 year old children with autism will be randomized to an intervention group or a control group. Children in both groups will continue their ordinary preschool program. However, the children in the intervention group will also participate in 80 joint attention intervention sessions. The sessions (20 minutes each) will be conducted twice a day for 8 weeks by preschool teachers or paraprofessionals working in the preschools. Before starting the intervention preschool teachers and paraprofessionals will be taught how to teach joint attention skills and how to initiate and maintain episodes of joint engagement. During the course of intervention they will be supervised by trained counselors.||Outcome measures will include joint attention skills, language skills and joint engagement. Children will be assessed at baseline, after 10 weeks and at follow up 6 months and 1 year after the end of the intervention. The measures are based on direct testing of the children, video observations and questionnaires to parent and professionals., autism|joint attention|intervention|joint engagement|language

Currently risperidone is the only medication approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for irritability associated with autism, although not all patients respond to risperidone or are able to tolerate its side effects. As such, additional targeted treatments need to be explored in autism. Neuroimmune disturbance has been demonstrated in patients with autism (Ashwood et al., 2006; DelGuidice, 2003) and the presence of neuroinflammation may play a role in initiating or maintaining CNS dysfunction characteristic of the disorder (Pardo et al, 2005). Therefore, there is considerable interest in using immunomodulatory medications to address core and associated symptoms.||Trichuris suis ova (TSO) are the eggs of intestinal helminthes which induce Th2 cytokine release and nonspecifically downregulate Th1 responsiveness (Summers et al., 2003). Treatment with TSO has been shown to have a beneficial effect in autoimmune inflammatory bowel disease (Summers et al, 2003; Summers et al., 2005a; Summers et al., 2005b) and anecdotal reports from patients with autism have demonstrated that TSO may be effective in reducing repetitive behaviors, aggression, self-injury, and impulsivity.||To date, many medications have been used in individuals with autism and the history of psychopharmacology of autism is notable for the exaggerated benefit of a variety of treatments. To date, most medication studies in the field have been open-label without use of a placebo control and without systematic behavioral assessments. The current practice of prescribing medications to patients with autism without scientifically demonstrated efficacy underscores the necessity for methodologically rigorous studies to be conducted.||We propose a double blind placebo-controlled crossover trial of TSO, where subjects would be randomized to receive placebo or TSO for 12 weeks, with a 4 week washout and then 12 weeks of the the treatment not yet received. To assess the effect on social cognition, repetitive behaviors, aggression and irritability, and global functioning in adults with autism spectrum disorder. The objectives of the proposed study are to develop an innovative treatment approach to autism by 1) assessing the safety and efficacy of TSO treatment using behavioral and laboratory outcome measures; 2) determining whether this treatment has sufficient promise to warrant consideration of a larger, multi-centered, placebo-controlled clinical trial; 3) conducting secondary analyses to explore the relationship between clinical features, immune mechanisms, and treatment response., Autism, Autism Spectrum Disorder|ASD|Trichuris Suis Ova|TSO|Treatment|Clinical Trial
0	"Gelsemium Sempervirens in Anticipatory Anxiety, State-anxiety can appear during banal events without objective harrowing factors. It is preponderant in particular situations as exams and competitive examination for example, and may be responsible of failures, notably at school. Particularly, a form of anxiety said anticipatory (largely named nerves) is focused on a coming performance. This anticipative anxiety, maximal before the beginning of the test, disappears during this test to let place to relief. Even if phenomenon of habituation exists, it can be responsible of social and professional failures.||Numerous therapeutics exists to fight against anxiety, non medicinal first but the resort to drugs are sometime necessary. The reference is the class of benzodiazepines. Many patients try non conventional medicines, like homeopathy.||Gelsemium sempervirens would be active on sensible et emotional persons, reducing anxiety in some situations. A large used of Gelsemium sempervirens is the case of a situation of provoked stress in particular exam. That is the reason why the drug is particularly intended to a population of young adults who don't want to use "" traditional "" tranquillizing. But this drug, largely used, has never showed his effectiveness on provoked anxiety, in biomedical research. That is why we proposed in this study to compare the effectiveness of Gelsemium sempervirens 5CH, Gelsemium sempervirens 15CH and placebo, in a situation of provoked anxiety in young adult healthy volunteers., stress provoked|healthy volunteers|gelsemium|homeopathy"

2	Treatment Study for Cognitive Deficits in Schizophrenia, The proposed study is a multicenter, randomized, double blind comparison of MK-0777 GEM 3 mg BID, MK-0777 GEM 8 mg BID, and placebo. The total sample will consist of 90 clinically stable patients with DSM IV TR schizophrenia, with 30 subjects randomized to each group. A best estimate diagnostic approach will be utilized, in which information from the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition) (First et al, 1997) is supplemented by information from family informants, previous psychiatrists, and medical records to generate a diagnosis. The projected number of subjects to be recruited from each site is 12-13. There will be a 2 week, placebo lead-in evaluation phase, in which subjects will undergo baseline diagnostic; medical, including a physical examination, EKG (electrocardiogram), CBC (Complete Blood Count), complete metabolic panel, urine toxicology, and UA (urinalysis); psychiatric; and neurocognitive, symptom level and functional capacity and patient self-report of cognitive function assessments. In addition, all subjects will receive a slit-lamp eye examination. At the end of the evaluation phase, subjects will be randomized to one of two MK-0777 doses or placebo. The double-blind treatment phase will be 4 weeks. Subjects will receive bi-weekly symptom assessments and weekly side effect and vital sign assessments. At week 4, subjects will undergo repeat administration of the neuropsychological test battery and the functional capacity and patient self-report of cognitive function measures. These assessments will be done over a two-day period. Subjects will have blood samples collected for antipsychotic and MK-0777 levels at week 4. An EKG (electrocardiogram) will be obtained at the end of the double-blind study. Slit-lamp eye examinations will be conducted at study completion, 6 months and 12 months after study completion. After the completion of the 4-week double-blind phase, there will be a 4-day follow-up phase during which subjects will be tapered off study medication.||Study Locations: The study will be conducted in the Treatment Units for Research on Neurocognition and Schizophrenia (TURNS) study network, which is comprised of seven sites: Columbia University School of Medicine (P.I.: Jeffrey Lieberman, M.D.); Duke University School of Medicine (P.I.: Joseph McEvoy, M.D.); Harvard University School of Medicine (P.I.: Donald Goff, M.D.); Maryland Psychiatric Research Center (MPRC) (P.I.: Robert W. Buchanan, M.D.); Nathan Kline Institute (P.I.: Daniel Javitt, M.D.) University of California Los Angeles School of Medicine (P.I.: Steve Marder, M.D.); and Washington University School of Medicine (P.I.: John Csernansky, M.D.). The TURNS is a NIMH-funded contract for the evaluation of new compounds for the treatment of cognitive impairments in schizophrenia (HHSN 27820044 1003C; P.I.: Steve Marder, M.D.). Data management will be performed by the Clinical Trials Data Management Unit of the Nathan Kline Institute under the direction of Jim Robinson, M.S., and statistical analysis will be performed by Dr. Robert McMahon of the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center. Laboratory assays will be performed by Quest Diagnostics.||Procedures:||Clinical Assessments: The symptom assessments will include the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale; Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS); Calgary Depression Scale (CDS); and Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI).||i) BPRS(Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale): the four positive symptom items (conceptual disorganization, suspiciousness, hallucinatory behavior, and unusual thought content) will be used to measure positive psychotic symptoms.||ii) SANS (Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms): the SANS total score, minus the global items, inappropriate affect, poverty of content of speech, and attention items, will be used to measure negative symptoms. The inappropriate affect, poverty of content of speech, and attention items are excluded as lacking construct validity and because factor analytic study results suggest that these items are not closely related to negative symptoms.||iii) CDS (Calgary Depression Scale): the CDS total score will be used to measure depressive symptoms.||iv) CGI (Clinical Global Impressions): the CGI severity of illness item will be used to assess global changes||Safety Assessments: The safety assessments will include the Simpson Angus Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (SAS); Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS); and Side Effect Checklist (SEC).||i) SAS: a modified 11 item version of the SAS will be used to assess EPS. ii) AIMS: is a 12 item scale, with 7 items designed to assess abnormal facial, oral, extremity, and trunk movements; 3 global judgment items; and 2 current dental status items.||iii) SEC: is designed to assess vital signs, commonly occurring antipsychotic side effects, and side effects indicative of uveitis or cataracts.||Subjects will be asked about adverse events at each visit, and instructed to call the study site should they experience adverse events at any point in the study. Any serious adverse event, including death due to any cause, which occurs to any subject entered into this study or within 14 days following cessation of treatment, whether or not related to the investigational product, will be reported to Merck & Co., Inc. within 24 hours.||Functional Assessments: The functional assessments will include the UCSD Performance-Based Skills Assessment (UPSA) and the Schizophrenia Cognition Rating Scale (SCoRS).||i) UPSA: is designed to assess skills in five areas: household chores, communication, finance, transportation, and planning recreational activities. Subjects are asked to perform tasks in each of these areas and scored according to their ability to complete the task. The UPSA takes 25 - 30 minutes to administer.||ii) SCoRS: is a rating scale designed to elicit information from the subject and informant on the level of cognitive function of the subject. The subject and informant versions both have 20 items. Subject and informant interviews take from 10 - 15 minutes to complete.||Neurocognitive Assessments: The NIMH MATRICS (Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia Research) Neuropsychological Battery, the Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR), the N-Back test; and the Continuous Performance Test (CPT-AX) will be used to assess cognitive function. The NIMH MATRICS Neuropsychological Battery is comprised of measures of: a) working memory; b) attention/vigilance; c) verbal memory; d) visual memory; e) processing speed; f) problem solving; and g) social cognition. The N-Back and CPT-AX are both computerized measures of prefrontal cortex dependent cognitive behavior.||Screening: The diagnosis of schizophrenia will be confirmed by a research psychiatrist using a modified version of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM IV (SCID). The BPRS, SANS, CDRS and SAS will be administered to verify that inclusionary criteria are met. Subjects will have a slit-lamp eye examination.||2 Week, Lead-in Evaluation Phase: In the 2 week lead-in evaluation phase, subjects will receive placebo. They will undergo baseline symptom, medical, safety, and neurocognitive assessments. The subjects will undergo a physical examination; including neurological exam, an EKG; and laboratory tests of major organ functions (i.e., CBC (complete blood count), liver function tests, electrolytes, glucose, BUN/Creatinine, Urinalysis (UA), urine toxicology, and thyroid functions). Baseline antipsychotic levels will be collected. All women will have a pregnancy test, unless they are either surgically or hormonally post menopausal.||4-Week Double Blind Treatment Phase: The study is a 4-week, placebo controlled, double blind study. Subjects will be randomized to either: MK-0777 GEM 3mg BID; MK-0777 GEM 8mg BID; or placebo. The unblinded site pharmacist will be notified of the treatment assignment, and will dispense study medication. Subjects will receive biweekly symptom assessments and weekly side effect and vital sign assessments. At week 4, subjects will undergo repeat administration of the neuropsychological test battery and the functional capacity and patient self-report of cognitive function measures. These assessments will be done over a two-day period. At week 4, subjects will also undergo a repeat slit lamp eye examination. We will also attempt to contact and schedule subjects who dropped out of the study prior to week 4 for the week 4 slit lamp eye examination. Finally, subjects will have blood samples collected for antipsychotic and MK-0777 levels at week 4.||6-Month and 12-Month Follow-up Evaluations: All subjects, regardless if they completed the 4-week double-blind treatment phase, will be contacted and scheduled for follow-up slit lamp eye examinations.||Randomization: Subjects will be randomly assigned to placebo or one of two doses of experimental treatment within strata defined by site.||Recruitment: Recruitment for potential subjects will be performed by reviewing subject records to determine eligibility based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Once qualifying records have been identified, potential subjects will be informed individually and/or in a group setting about the study., Cognition|Schizophrenia
1	Open Label of Clinical Trial of Sulforaphane in Children With Autism, Sulforaphane (SF) is an isothiocyanate found in high levels in crucifers belonging to the family Brassicaceae (including broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, brussels sprouts, Chinese cabbage and turnips). Many previous studies have documented that consumption of these vegetables is associated with a reduced risk of cancer (lung, breast, colon, rectum, and prostate).(Juge et al. 2007) The mechanism of action of these beneficial effects is believed to be due to the ability of SF to up-regulate genes that improve cellular response to oxidative stress, inflammation, DNA-damaging electrophiles, and radiation.(Singh et al. 2014) In a recent small, randomized controlled trial in children with autism, SF was shown to have beneficial effects on aberrant and social behavior.(Singh et al. 2014) The mechanism of action of this beneficial effect has not been established in children with ASD. Our primary goal is to examine changes in urinary metabolites in children with autism who receive SF to determine if changes in behavior are associated with changes in urinary metabolites., 0
2	rTMS on Appetite and Cognitive Function in Schizophrenia, The weight gain and metabolic dysfunction has been vital conditions for individuals with schizophrenia. The cognitive function deficit has also been a major symptom for schizophrenia. However, metabolic dysfunction could further impair the cognition. rTMS is a promising novel intervention, which have strong potentials on moderating increased appetite and cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, as it has been proved for the treatment of depression.||Therefore, the investigators designed this randomized controlled clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rTMS, using iTBS pattern, on prevention of the elevated appetite and cognitive deficiency in individual with schizophrenia. The intervention will last for 5 continuous days and the follow-ups are scheduled at baseline, 6days and 36days. The primary outcomes include the change of MCCB score, TFEQ score and EEG data. Secondary outcomes include the change of serum metabolic indexes and anthropometry indexes., Schizophrenia|rTMS|Appetite|Cognitive Function

In 2001, the National Cancer Policy Board of the Institute of Medicine and National Research Council issued a report (Improving Palliative Care for Cancer: Summary and Recommendations) that specifically recommended research be conducted using novel agents and methods. Psilocybin is a novel agent which produces a profound alteration in your state of consciousness. It is the main active ingredient found in ""magic mushrooms"".||Our specific aim is to learn whether this psychoactive drug, psilocybin, might be effective in reducing anxiety, depression and physical pain, and therefore improving your quality of life. This pilot study will start with 12 people ages 18-70. For each participant there will be two overnight admissions to the hospital. In one session you will be given a placebo and in the other you will get the active medication, but no one will know which drug is administered when. This is called a double blind study. You will be asked to fill out questionnaires about how you feel, your pain levels and your moods. There will also be at least two psychotherapy meetings before the study sessions, so that you are fully aware of what to expect and to have all your questions answered.||We cannot take you in the study if you have central nervous system (CNS) cancers, kidney disease, diabetes, abnormal liver function tests, epilepsy, cardiovascular disease including untreated high blood pressure (BP greater than 140/90), and pregnancy. The psychiatric exclusions are: you or an immediate family member with a history of a major psychiatric disorder, a current substance abuse problem, or an anxiety or a mood disorder within 1 year prior to the onset of symptoms of your current illness.||We also cannot take you in the study if you are taking certain medications, such as: anti-seizure, insulin and oral hypoglycemics, and cardiovascular drugs (except anti-hypertensive medications). Some antidepressant (SSRIs) medications cannot be taken within the two weeks prior to the session (except for Prozac, which cannot be taken in the last 5 weeks prior to the session).||You will get a MRI of the brain prior to admission (if you haven't had one in the prior two months), at the study's expense, to be sure there is no CNS involvement. You can provide us, or the study will pay for, lab work from the prior 2 weeks (CBC, liver function and renal function). The history and physical, neurological exam, EKG, and a urine pregnancy test (if you are a woman with child-bearing potential), will be done on admission by the house staff doctors.||You will be allowed to take your own medications while in the hospital, and will be encouraged to bring to the hospital personal photos, small memorabilia, and some of your favorite music that can be played during the sessions., Anxiety|Depression|Mood|Cancer|Quality of Life|Psychiatric|Psilocybin|Alternative|Los Angeles"

2	The Effectiveness of the Meta-cognitive Training Among Patients With Chronic Schizophrenia, 50 patients with established schizophrenia diagnosis will be included and randomized into two conditions: MCT (n= 25) and TAU (n=25). Exclusion criteria are: neurological diseases, substance dependence (alcohol and drugs).||A broad outcome measures will be provided including symptoms severity, cognitive biases, neurocognition, insight and social functioning. Changes in variable after the intervention will be compared between two condition.||Only patients with established schizophrenia with no neurological diseases will be included.||All patients will be assessed at two time points: T0 - at baseline, up to one week before the intervention starts and T1 up to one week after the intervention is finished. T1 assessment will be at 4-5 weeks after the study begun.||Measures||General functioning General Assessment of Functioning was used as a measure of the severity of patients' functional disabilities.|Insigh A questionnaire of insight into schizophrenia consists of six items targeting insight. The scale has a good reliability with Cronbach's alpha 0.8.|The subjective sense of influence on the course of schizophrenia The Brief Measure to Assess Perception of the Self-influence on the Disease Course - Version for Schizophrenia consists of five items targeting different aspects of subjective sense of influence on the course of schizophrenia. The scale has satisfactory psychometric properties (Cronbach's alpha= 0.78).||4, Psychotic symptoms The severity of delusions and hallucinations were assessed at the baseline and after the intervention with the semi-structured Psychotic Symptom Rating Scale (The PSYRATS). The PSYRATS comprises hallucination and delusions subscale, each design to assess psychological aspects of the symptoms on a five point scale from 0 to 4. The items for the hallucination scale are: frequency (PH1); duration (PH2); location (PH3); loudness (PH4); beliefs regarding the origin of voices (PH5); amount of negative content of voices (PH6); degree of negative content (PH7); amount of distress (PH8); intensity of distress (PH9); disruption to life caused by voices (PH10); controlability of voices (PH11). The delusion subscale consists of six items: amount of preoccupation with delusions (PD1); duration of preoccupation with delusions (PD2); conviction (PD3); amount of distress (PD4); intensity of distress (PD5); disruption to life caused by beliefs (PD6). The PSYRATS has good psychometric properties and have been reported being sensitive to symptoms change over time. In addition the Paranoia Checklist which comprises 18 items, each rated on 5 point scale for frequency, distress and degree of conviction, was used in order to assess delusional ideations. The participants were asked to state if they experience different delusional ideation during the last week before filling out the questionnaire.||5. Cognitive Biases. Cognitive Biases Questionnaire for Psychosis consists of 30 vignettes of everyday life scenarios. Participants are asked to imagine themselves as being in the situation and then choose one out of four cognitive responses indicating specific cognitive biases. CBQp comprises of seven subscales: anomalous perceptions (AP); threatening events (TE); intentionalising (I); catastrophising (C); dichotomous thinking (DT); jumping to conclusion (JTC); emotion based reasoning (ER).||In addition two behavioral tasks were used in order to assess the most prominent cognitive biases in schizophrenia, that is to say jumping to conclusion and theory of mind deficits. In the Fish Task the participants are presented with two lakes with different proportion of grey and orange fishes. In the first lake (lake A) there is 80% grey and 20% of orange fishes. The proportion of fishes in the lake B is reversed. Participants are presented with the fisherman who stands between lakes to catch fishes, but he is allowed to do that only from one lake during the entire experiment. Participants on the computer screen were presented with fishes. Two responses were gathered: 1) the participant should make the confidence judgment by indicating from 0-100% how confident they are regarding the fish is from lake A or lake B; 2) whether the participant has enough evidences for the final decision on the fish is from lake A or B. Two alternative versions of the Fish Task were used for pre- and post-test. We analyzed a number of fishes that were considered by participants for the final decision. The less fishes were considered the more the participant has jumping to conclusions tendencies.||Reading the Mind from Eyes Test (RMET,) was used in order to assess the deficits in the theory of mind. The test consists of 36 different faces pictures restricted to eyes area only. Based on the face expression participant is asked to infer the emotional state of the person presented on the picture. We split the original 36 pictures test into two separate tests for the pre- and post-test. In addition to original test we included the conviction question in which participants responded how confident they are in their decisions (100% sure). The RMET test has good psychometric properties and has been used often in schizophrenia.||6. Global neurocognitive functioning Trial making test (TMT) A and B was used to assess global cognitive flexibility. TMT A test is design to test psychomotor speed and attention. TMT B test targets the data on the cognitive flexibility.||All tests will be administered at T0 (baseline assessment up to one week before intervention) and T1 (up to one week after the intervention )., schizophrenia;|meta-cognition;|general functioning;|positive symptoms;|insight;

2	A Study on the Brain Mechanism of cTBS in Improving Medication-resistant Auditory Hallucinations in Schizophrenia, Previous studies have shown that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) targeted at the temporal-parietal junction can effectively treat genenal auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia, but it is not the case for medication-resistant auditory hallucinations. Studies suggested that rTMS targeted at the left Crus II might be effective for medication-resistant auditory hallucinations. This study is dedicated to exploring the brain mechanism of medication-resistant auditory hallucinations and developing effective treatment methods for them by using both cross-sectional and longitudinal designs. The continuous theta burst stimulation(cTBS) treatment mode, with the left cerebellum Crus II as the stimulation target, is applied to treat the schizophrenia patients with the medication-resistant auditory hallucinations. Assessment with symptomatology, neuropsychology, neuroimaging, and machine learning methods is utilized to examine the investigators hypothesis that structural and functional abnormalities of the cerebral cortico-cerebellar-thalamic-cortical circuit (CCTCC) may contribute to brain mechanism of medication-resistant auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia. At the same time, the first-episode schizophrenia patients with auditory hallucinations were recruited as a test cohort to examine that brain mechanism of general auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia may be the structural and functional abnormalities in the temporoparietal circuit, whereas structural and functional abnormalities of the CCTCC may contribute to brain mechanism of medication-resistant auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia., Medication-Resistant Auditory Hallucinations|Continuous theta burst stimulation，cTBS|Neuroimaging

2	"Brain Imaging, Attention, and Auditory Processing in Schizophrenia, EEG recording: In this procedure, the researcher will assess the participant's brain function while performing simple computer-based tasks. The computer tasks involve presentation of pictures or sounds to which the participant responds by pressing a button. The investigators will also record some of the participant's own speech sounds and play them back to them. The participant will be given clear instructions and a chance to practice before each task. While you are performing these tasks, the investigator will record the weak electrical signals produced by your brain, or ""brain waves"", using a technique called electroencephalography (EEG). In order to record the participant's EEG, sensors (small plastic discs) will be attached to specific locations on their scalp. The participant's scalp will be gently scrubbed before the sensors are attached. The sensors are held in place on the scalp using a nylon cap that fits snugly on the head. Sensors will also be attached above and below the participant's eyes and will record their eye movements. It will take approximately one hour to attach the sensors. The entire EEG will take approximately 2-3 hours. Before taking part in the EEG session, please make sure to wash hair and scalp. Do not use conditioner or a 2-in-1 shampoo/conditioner. The participant's hair should be dry before arrival. The investigators ask this in order to make the set-up process go more smoothly.||During some tasks, participants will feel a vibratory sensation that is produced with an electrical current and it is possible that it may feel like a slight shock. The current is controlled and cannot reach levels that are painful or dangerous. Every participant experiences this sensation differently, so it is important that participants tell the researchers if the sensation becomes uncomfortable to you so the current can be adjusted or the task can be stopped.|Participants may be asked to complete additional EEGs for this study, depending on your interest in participating and your availability. All EEG sessions will last approximately 2 hrs.||MRI: In the fMRI procedure, we will use a magnet to measure blood flow to participants' brains while they do different tasks. Participants will be asked to lie down on a platform that can be slid into the middle of the magnet. A plastic MRI imaging coil will be placed around participants' heads. You will not come into contact with the coil during the experiment. Foam pads will be placed around the participant's head to limit head movement during the experiment. The investigators will then slide you into the magnet. At different points during the experiment, participants will be asked to do the same tasks they did in the training session prior to the scan. During the scan, participants will be asked to either lie still and rest, or do some tasks like tapping their fingers, remembering letters or digits, or viewing images that are designed to activate different parts of the brain. The entire MRI will take approximately two hours.||While performing the MRI, participants may be asked to wear a cap that contains multiple EEG sensors applied to your scalp. A removable gel will be used. The EEG measures electrical activity produced by the brain while participants undergo the MRI. Set up for the EEG will take approximately 30 to 60 minutes.|Participants may be asked to repeat an MRI session if the data the study team collects is not usable due to data quality issues, or if the participant is unable to stay awake in the magnet during your scan.|Brief interview session: There will be a series of questions about participants' education, smoking status, and economic background. Participants will also be given a list of words to read to the researcher. If the participant is a patient diagnosed with one of the above-mentioned psychiatric disorders, they will be asked to participate in an additional interview, lasting about one hour, focusing on how they have been feeling recently.|Behavioral testing: In this part, the participant will use a touch screen computer, mouse and/or paper and pencil to perform certain visual and auditory tests of your mental abilities. Specifically, these tests will assess participants' memory, attention, language, and motor skills. This testing will last approximately one hour. Depending on the participant's preference, this testing can be done on the same day as an EEG or on a different day. The order of the two sessions does not matter, so long as they occur within one week of each other.||Additional Information:||If information about a participant's mental health is needed from their current or former doctor(s), they will be asked to sign a separate permission form before the researcher can contact their doctor(s)., 0"
2	Effects of Cognitive Remediation Therapy on Schizophrenia Patients Through Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, A controlled randomized study will be carry out with three different groups: patients receiving cognitive rehabilitation treatment (CRT), patients receiving another psychological intervention of control and a healthy control group. A descriptive study of cases will be also carried out. The functional MRI (fRMI) techniques as well as voxel-based morphometry allow individual analysis of cases.||The independent variable is the cognitive rehabilitation treatment. The CRT will be applied according to the manual of Wykes & Reeder (2005) Cognitive Remediation Therapy: Theory and Practice, Ed: Routledge. The program has a duration of 40 sessions (one hour of duration), with two sessions for week during four months. It is carried out individually and utilizes paper and pencil tasks. The main technique utilized is the scaffolding (to provide strategies when the patient cannot carry out the task and to withdraw him when he is yet able of doing it alone) in a context of learning without errors.||The main dependent variable is the functional connectivity cerebral pattern obtained by means of functional magnetic resonance. Other secondary dependent variables are neurocognitive functioning, the symptomatic pattern and the psychosocial functioning obtained from the psychometric evaluation.||All the participants will be evaluated before and after the experimental intervention in neurocognitive areas (Battery will be composed by WAIS-III, RAVLT, Trail Making Test, STROOP color word, WCST, FAS-COWAT), symptomatic area (PANSS) and in social functioning (Social Functioning Scale SFS; Birchwood et al. 1990).

1	SynapDx Autism Gene Expression Analysis Study (STORY), The primary aim of this study is to define a gene expression signature indicative of ASD and to establish its clinical sensitivity and specificity. Clinician diagnosis of ASD will be made using DSM-5 as the reference standard instrument. The widely used diagnostic instrument Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2) is a typical component of the clinical assessment for a child diagnosed with ASD and this evaluation will be performed on all study participants. Secondary aims of this study are (1) to define metabolite and lipid signatures indicative of ASD and establish their clinical sensitivity and specificity and (2) to determine clinical sensitivity and specificity of various combinations of gene expression signature, metabolite and/or lipid signatures, and presence of ASD-associated genetic variation detected by CMA and sequencing protein-coding regions of the genome||Analyses: Details of the analysis will be specified in a Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), which will include procedures for handling outliers, missing data, and differences across sites. The SAP will be reviewed and approved by a committee of Principal Investigators (PIs) before unblinding of the validation set.||Primary analyses: The primary outcomes of the study will be the estimates of the clinical sensitivity and specificity of the SDX-002 test to classify subjects according to DSM-5 ASD diagnosis, with associated 95% confidence intervals. Sensitivity and specificity will be assessed on the Validation Phase population based on agreement with the clinical diagnosis of presence or absence of Autism Spectrum Disorder by DSM-5 (published May 2013).||The gene expression signature will be trained on the 500 subject Development Phase set, using 5-fold cross validation over the results of several machine learning algorithms, including partial least squares, support vector machines, and boosted decision trees. The training procedure will generate estimated ROC curves for each method, as well as confidence intervals for the area under the curve (AUC). The final choice of a machine-learning algorithm will be based on AUC, as well as on the estimated performance at the chosen operating point on the ROC curve. The operating point will be chosen to provide high sensitivity at an acceptable specificity.||Secondary analyses: In the majority of patients enrolled to date, consent was obtained for collection of an optional bio-repository sample. The intended analysis of the bio-repository samples has now been established (see also, secondary objectives listed above). The metabolomic and lipomic signatures will be similarly assessed on the subset of the 500 subjects in the Development Phase set who consent to a bio-repository sample. In addition to the gene expression signature, metabolite and/or lipid signatures and DNA analysis will be combined with the gene expression signature in various configurations and the impact of these additional measures on clinical sensitivity and specificity will be evaluated. If these additional metabolomic/lipomic signatures and/or DNA analyses improve test performance, these elements may be included in the SDX-002 assay.||Sensitivity and specificity the final SDX-002 assay will also be assessed among subpopulations using demographic information and the results of developmental testing. There are likely to be few subjects in many of these subpopulations and caution will be used in interpreting the results. Planned subpopulation analyses include gender, age, ethnicity, ASD DSM-IV-TR diagnostic subcategory, DSM-5 ASD severity level (social communication and restricted interests/repetitive behaviors) and ADOS-2 scores., Autism|Autism Spectrum Disorders|RNA|Gene expression|Developmental Delay|Metabolites|DNA

2	Microglia Activation in Schizophrenia, Schizophrenia is a complex and chronic disease that affects different aspects of cognition and behaviour, including attention, perception, thought processes, emotion and volition. Schizophrenia is a brain disease particularly involving decrement in gray matter as has been supported by findings from many imaging studies. The pathophysiology of these gray matter changes has not been clarified. Microglia activation is the consequence of virtually all conditions associated with neuronal injury. When activated following neuronal damage, microglia show a marked increase in the expression of peripheral type benzodiazepine binding sites which are particularly abundant on cells of the mononuclear macrophage.||(R)-PK11195 [1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-1(1-methylpropyl]-3 isoquinolinecarboxamide) is a highly selective ligand for the peripheral benzodiazepine binding site. (R)-PK11195, labelled with the positron emitter carbon-11, can be used to monitor the peripheral type benzodiazepine receptors using Positron Emission Tomography (PET). At the Vrije Universiteit Medical Centre (R)-[11C]PK11195 is used for studying microglia activation in-vivo in patients with traumatic brain damage, minimal cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease.||The objective of this study is to determine whether and to what extent microglia activation occurs in schizophrenia. Ten patients with schizophrenia will be recruited and 10 controls, matched for age and gender. This is an open study. The study consists of one PET scan, which will be performed at the Clinical PET Centre of the Vrije Universiteit Medical Centre. All subjects will also get a MRI scan, which will be performed at the department of Radiology, University Medical Centre Utrecht., schizophrenia|microglia|PET

2	"Effect of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation on Resting State Brain Activity in Schizophrenia, Background. The sub-Investigator Dr. Mennemeier has been using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to treat phantom sound perception in subjects with tinnitus. The Principal Investigator (PI), Dr. Messias, now aims to team up with Drs. Mennemeier and James, to learn how rTMS influences phantom sound perception in schizophrenia. rTMS has already been shown to be an effective treatment for both tinnitus and schizophrenia. rTMS is a non-invasive method of regional brain stimulation that can significantly reduce phantom sound perception temporarily in 50% of subjects with tinnitus and schizophrenia. This study will go further than previous investigations by analyzing how different frequencies of rTMS influence not only auditory hallucinations (AH) in schizophrenia but also brain connectivity in schizophrenia. The investigators want to learn if rTMS decreases AH by normalizing brain connectivity. Whereas this study focuses on schizophrenic subjects with AH, the design is very similar to ongoing work on tinnitus so the findings will be comparable.||Tinnitus and AH in schizophrenia are prevalent and disabling disorders of sound perception. The investigators understanding of the precise mechanisms of these disorders is lacking. Interestingly, the symptoms of both disorders respond positively to rTMS of the temporal cortex in ways that defy contemporary understanding of the nature of these symptoms and of how rTMS should work to improve them. For example, phantom sound perception in both tinnitus and schizophrenia are linked to maladaptive, hyperactivity of auditory processing regions of temporal cortex; however, it is increasingly clear that these pathological changes alone are insufficient to explain the pronounced intrusiveness and negative emotional valance of symptoms in each disorder. Therefore, a barrier to understanding these disorders lies in understanding how changes in auditory cortex are synchronized with changes in other cortical regions that regulate perception and emotion. Additionally, at present, the decision of which rTMS frequency to apply as a treatment for phantom sound perception has no firm theoretical or empirical basis. Whereas, low frequency rTMS has traditionally been used, based upon contemporary models, to ""inhibit"" hyperactivity in auditory cortex; high frequency rTMS, which should induce an opposite effect on neuronal processing, not only works to improve symptoms but may be more effective for some subjects than low frequency rTMS. Therefore, contemporary models designed to explain how the frequency of rTMS influences neuronal activity immediate following stimulation are insufficient to explain how low and high frequencies of rTMS can mitigate phantom sound perception for days, weeks and months following a single course of treatment.||Hypothesis. The investigators propose that phantom sound perception in schizophrenia result from an imbalance of excitatory and inhibitory neural process in auditory networks and from synchronized, maladaptive changes in linked brain regions that regulate perception and emotion. Treating auditory cortex with repetitive, external magnetic stimulation can decrease phantom sound perception and distress by reversing the maladaptive brain reorganization that is set in motion by these underlying neural imbalances., Schizophrenia|Auditory hallucinations (AH)|Phantom sound perception|repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)|Percent habituation in the P50 amplitude with 250 ms ISI"
2	The Effects of tDCS on Illness Awareness in Schizophrenia, Transcranial DCS is a novel, non-invasive and non-convulsive technique for altering brain function. To our knowledge, no research has investigated the functional and behavioural effects of tDCS on anosognosia in schizophrenia. As such, we aim to improve impaired illness awareness in schizophrenia with tDCS by inhibiting left hemisphere regions (i.e. temporoparietooccipital cortex) shown by our group to be activated during illness denial.||Positive results will demonstrate that impaired illness awareness in schizophrenia involves a similar brain network to impaired illness awareness in patients with brain lesions and can be similarly modulated with non-invasive techniques, such as tDCS. If proven effective, this easy to administer, safe, non-invasive intervention would have the potential to alter individuals' attitude towards their illness and medication, leading ultimately to an improvement in individuals' capacity for illness recognition and treatment engagement, which would undoubtedly have a significant impact on the management of this devastating mental disorder., Magnetic resonance imaging|Anosognosia|Electrical stimulation of the brain

2	A Study of the Efficacy and Safety of Long-acting Injectable Risperidone and Risperidone Tablets in Patients With Schizophrenia, Although many schizophrenia patients currently take oral antipsychotic medications, it is estimated that up to 75% of them have difficulty adhering to the daily oral regimen. Long-acting injectable formulations may eliminate the need for daily medication and enhance patient compliance with the treatment regimen. This is an open-label, randomized, Phase III trial in patients with schizophrenia. One treatment group receives 25 to 50 mgs of long-acting risperidone, formulated for intramuscular injections, at study initiation and again after 2 weeks, while phasing out any previous antipsychotic medication during the initial 3 weeks of the study. Continuing in the treatment phase, long-acting injections are administered once every 2 weeks through Week 24, and post-treatment observation is performed for 6 weeks (total study duration of 30 weeks). Patients in the other treatment group take oral risperidone tablets, 2 to 6 mgs daily, from study initiation for 24 weeks. Post-treatment observation continues for 1 week for this group (total study duration of 25 weeks). Assessments of effectiveness made at specified intervals during treatment include Positive And Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), a scale for the measurement of symptoms of schizophrenia; Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S), a measure of overall severity of illness, and Clinical Global Impression - Changes (CGI-C); as well as, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). Safety evaluations include the incidence of adverse events throughout the study; inspection of the injection site at times of treatment; Drug-Induced Extrapyramidal Symptoms Scale (DIEPSS), vital signs (pulse, blood pressure, temperature), and laboratory tests (hematology, biochemistry, urinalysis) at monthly intervals. The study hypothesis is that treatment with long-acting risperidone injections is not inferior to oral risperidone, as measured by changes in PANSS total score from baseline through endpoint (24 weeks), in patients with schizophrenia and is generally well-tolerated. Risperidone, long-acting formulation for intramuscular injections (25 milligrams[mg] to 50mg, maximum), given biweekly through 24 weeks.

2	"Study to Measure Drug Satisfaction of Patients With Schizophrenia After Switching From Risperidone to Paliperidone, Paliperidone ER has been shown to be effective compared to placebo (""a sugar pill"") in the acute treatment and maintenance of patients with schizophrenia. Paliperidone ER combines an active metabolite of another antipsychotic, risperidone, with manufacturing technology allowing more gradual release of the drug and less difference in high and low blood levels of the drug. Side effects to medications are sometimes due to wide differences in these high and low blood levels. Recent research has shown that many patients with schizophrenia discontinue their antipsychotic medication due to ""subject-choice"". Therefore, it is important that research studies attempt to measure patients' satisfaction with antipsychotic medication, in addition to measuring how they respond on tests of effectiveness. This study has been designed to evaluate antipsychotic medication satisfaction in patients who continue to have symptoms of schizophrenia, and who say they are dissatisfied with their current risperidone treatment. The primary outcome is the change in the Medication Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSQ) score, from baseline to the Week 6 endpoint. These patients are randomized (like flipping a coin) as to when their risperidone (4 mg to 6 mg per day) is switched to paliperidone ER. Because the study is 'blinded', neither the study doctor nor the patient will know when treatment with risperidone is stopped and treatment with paliperidone ER begins. Throughout the study all patients continue to receive antipsychotic medication daily. Patients will continue on the same daily dose of risperidone until their randomly assigned switch to paliperidone ER. All patients will be switched to paliperidone ER over the course of study and once switched continue to take paliperidone ER for the remainder of the study. Paliperidone ER is started at 6 mg/day and can be increased to 9 mg/day or 12 mg/day at the doctor's discretion. Effectiveness and safety will be measured at visits scheduled weekly for the first four weeks and then at the Week 6 endpoint. At each visit, patients will be asked to complete psychiatric tests and questionnaires that will measure effectiveness and patient satisfaction with the medicine. They will also complete tests and evaluations for safety, including electrocardiograms (ECGs, electrical tracings of the heart) and blood samples at the beginning and end of the study. Each patient receives two blinded capsules by mouth once daily in the morning for 6 weeks. Patients taking risperidone receive either a 4-mg or 6-mg capsule plus a placebo capsule. When patients are switched, Paliperidone ER is started at 6 mg/day the day after risperidone is discontinued and can be increased to 9 mg/day or 12 mg/day at the doctor's discretion. Paliperidone 3-mg and 6-mg capsules are combined with placebo to equal the total dose in two capsules., schizophrenia|medication satisfaction, Invega"
2	Combination of NMDA-enhancing and Antioxidant Treatments for Schizophrenia, Several lines of evidence suggest that both NMDA and oxidative stress hypotheses have been implicated in schizophrenia. Previous studies found that some NMDA-enhancing agents were able to augment efficacy of antipsychotics in the treatment of schizophrenia. In addition, several drugs with antioxidant properties have been tested in clinical trials for the treatment of schizophrenia too. Whether a drug with antioxidant property can strengthen the efficacy of an NMDA-enhancer (NMDAE) in the treatment of schizophrenia remains unknown. Therefore, this study aims to compare NMDAE plus a drug with antioxidant property and NMDAE plus placebo in the treatment of schizophrenia. The subjects are the schizophrenia patients who remain symptomatic while having been stabilized with antipsychotic treatment. They keep their original treatment and are randomly, double-blindly assigned into two treatment groups for 12 weeks: (1) NMDAE plus Antioxidant agent (AO), or (2) NMDAE plus placebo. Clinical performances and side effects are measured at weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12. Cognitive functions are assessed at baseline and at endpoint of treatment by a battery of tests. The efficacies of NMDAE plus AO and NMDAE plus placebo will be compared.||Chi-square (or Fisher's exact test) will be used to compare differences of categorical variables and t-test (or Mann-Whitney test if the distribution is not normal) for continuous variables between treatment groups. Mean changes from baseline in repeated-measure assessments will be assessed using the generalized estimating equation (GEE). All p values for clinical measures will be based on two-tailed tests with a significance level of 0.05., Schizophrenia|NMDA|Oxidative stress

2	Improving Cognition in Schizophrenia Using tDCS, The investigators plan to recruit 40 individuals diagnosed with Schizophrenia. Participants will range from 18-55 years old. We will select stable, medicated patients who have not been hospitalized nor had any changes in their antipsychotic medications during the previous two months. Participants will not be tested within 12 hours of taking medications that may affect cognition (such as benzodiazepines and anticholinergics). All medications will be recorded. The investigators expect most of the patients to be relatively chronic (mean illness chronicity approximately 15 years, based on previous studies), although we will not select for chronicity.||All participants will provide written informed consent after receiving a full explanation of the procedures according to approvals by the Institutional Review Boards. They will arrive for three visits. In the first visit, they will be consented, complete the diagnostic interview, the rating scales, and will undergo one of three randomly assigned stimulation conditions: 1) anodal tDCS, 2) cathodaltDCS, and 3) sham stimulation. They will also undergo an electroencephalography (EEG) procedure, in order to more directly assess the effect of tDCS on brain function. This visit will take approximately five hours to complete, and breaks will be given as needed. Immediately following stimulation, participants will complete neurocognitive, social cognitive, and EEG measures. There will be two 20-minute stimulation sessions, with a break of one hour between the sessions. After each session, participants will be asked to complete a portion of the basic cognitive, social cognitive, and EEG measures, so that half of the measures will be completed after the first 20 minute stimulation session and the other half will be completed after the second 20 minute stimulation session. The order of administration of the neurocognitive, social cognitive, and EEG measures will be randomized across participants within each group. During the second and third visits, participants will undergo the remaining two stimulation conditions, one randomly assigned condition each visit. These visits will take approximately four hours to complete, and each visit will be separated by at least one week from the previous visit., 0
2	Effects of Oxytocin on Negative Symptoms and Social Cognition in Schizophrenia and Its Possible Mechanisms, Social impairment is a primary cause of disability in schizophrenia, responds poorly to current antipsychotic medications and is related to deficits in social cognitive abilities, which include Theory of Mind, emotion recognition and attributional style. Oxytocin (OT) has many pro-social effects in animals and antipsychotic-like efficacy in preclinical tests. In this study, the investigators conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled trial testing the effects of twice daily intranasal oxytocin treatment for 14 days on psychotic symptoms and social cognition in patients with schizophrenia. The investigators will recruit patients with schizophrenia, screening of subjects included a review of psychiatric and medical history, physical examination, baseline social cognition measures were obtained followed by psychiatric ratings. Daily intranasal treatments were initiated after baseline assessments. Social cognition measures and psychiatric ratings were repeated beginning 50 min after the morning dose of study medication on treatment day 14. psychiatric ratings include The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and The Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms (CAINS). The social cognition instruments are some social scales such as Toronto Alexithymia Scale, the Interpersonal Reactivity Index(IRI), and some computer tests such as reinforcement learning task and facial emotion identification test., schizophrenia|negative symptoms|oxytocin
2	The Influence of Aerobic Exercise on Cognitive Functioning in Schizophrenia., Individuals with schizophrenia often display cognitive difficulties. Studies among non-clinical populations suggest that Aerobic Exercise (AE) training is effective in increasing both aerobic fitness and cognitive functioning. However, these associations have not been studied among individuals with schizophrenia, despite the presence of highly sedentary lifestyle in this population To elucidate this putative link, the present study will evaluate the influence of AE on cognitive functioning and daily functioning in individuals with schizophrenia using a single-blind, randomized clinical trial. Outpatient individuals with schizophrenia receiving treatment will be randomly assigned to AE training or Treatment As Usual (TAU). Participants in the AE training will undergo a 12-week, 3 times per week, 1-hour AE sessions. All participants will continue their regular psychiatric and medical care. Assessments of neurocognitive and daily functioning abilities, along with symptom severity, and physiological and behavioral measures of aerobic fitness will be completed before and after the 12-week program., Schizophrenia|Cognition|Aerobic Exercise

1	The Effects of a Clean Room Sleeping Environment on Elemental and Chemical Concentrations in Children With Autism, Autism spectrum disorders are characterized behaviorally by expressive language and social deficits, the performance of stereotypic and repetitive behavior patterns, and abnormal cognitive functioning. Children with autism spectrum disorders often do not have known anomalies seen on genetic testing. An emerging paradigm suggests that the majority of children with autism are displaying a pattern of genetic / environmental interaction that make them susceptible to difficulties with detoxification of the heavy metal and chemical environment. Children with autism demonstrate increased difficulty with the performance of methylation and sulfation required for the elimination of fat soluble chemicals from human tissues. These children also commonly display dysfunction of their metalloprotein systems necessary for the elimination of heavy metals such as mercury and arsenic from their bodies.||This study sought to provide 10 children with autism an opportunity to sleep in a clean room environment, a hospital room that was modified to remove nearly all traces of particulate matter, chemicals, and heavy metals, for a 2 week period while going about their normal activities during the day. In the clean room, the children slept on bedding and wore clothes that did not release any toxins. This room created a concentration gradient for chemical and heavy metal toxins that may have allowed these toxins to leave the children's bodies during their stays.||The children's parents filled out seven rating scales, including the Aberrant Behavior Checklist, immediately before and after the 2 week sleeping periods. The children had blood samples taken before and after the 2 week sleeping experiences that measured biomarkers of metalloprotein (heavy metal elimination) and immune functioning, such as the plasma zinc/serum copper ratio and T and B cell subsets. Red blood cell and hair concentrations of toxic heavy metals such as mercury, arsenic, and chromium 6, and red blood cell concentrations of chemicals implicated in contributing to human pathology, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diethyl ethers (PBDEs), and phthalates were determined before and after the sleeping experiences. These pre and post stay variables were statistically compared, and it was hypothesized that the children's red blood cell concentrations of toxins would be significantly reduced while their hair concentrations of toxins would be significantly increased after their sleeping experiences in the clean room, supporting the concept that the clean room promoted the release of heavy metals and chemicals from their bodies. This one year study was a proof of concept cohort study., autism, cleanroom, immune dysregulation, toxins

This study is projected to randomize approximately 462 subjects to 3 treatment groups (SEP-363856 75 mg/day, SEP-363856 100 mg/day, or placebo) in a 1:1:1 ratio. Treatment assignment will be stratified by country. Study drug will be taken once a day and may be taken with or without food.||This study is designed to test the hypotheses that treatment with SEP-363856 in adult subjects with schizophrenia will result in significantly greater reduction (i.e. improvement) in PANSS total score and CGI-S score at Week 6 from Baseline when compared to placebo. The overall Type I error is controlled for two hierarchical families of hypotheses. The first family includes hypotheses about the testing of change from Baseline in PANSS total score at Week 6 between each of the SEP-363856 dose levels vs. placebo. The second family of hypotheses are about the testing of change from Baseline in CGI-S score at Week 6 between each of the SEP-363856 dose levels vs. placebo., acute psychosis|Schizophrenia

2	Clinical Effectiveness of Newer Antipsychotics in Comparison With Conventional Antipsychotics in Schizophrenia, There is agreement in the psychiatry community that the so-called atypical antipsychotics should be considered first choice in the treatment of schizophrenic disorders. However, the general superiority of these newer antipsychotic drugs over the older conventional drugs could not be clearly demonstrated in recent controlled clinical trials. The discrepancy between every day's clinical perception and the results of clinical trials raises the question whether the studies performed so far employed the adequate methodological approach to represent the daily practice situation which is characterized by a wide variety of duration and type of the schizophrenic disorder, concomitant diseases, and medications. Moreover, some studies might not have been focused adequately on patient-relevant outcome variables.||The present study project is designed to answer these open questions. The innovative character of the study design is||that different neuroleptic strategies will be compared rather than single antipsychotic drugs, using|an enhanced biometric design, that provides a choice of treatment with respect to the individual patient though the trial as such is randomised controlled and double blind;|that clinically relevant endpoints such as quality of life will be the primary variables, and|inclusion and exclusion criteria lead to a study population representing clinical every day practice as near as possible.||Another innovatory procedure is that serum levels of the study drugs will be recorded twice during the study.

2	Dopamine Function and Reward Processing In Schizophrenia, Objective:||Schizophrenia (SC) is associated with cognitive impairment in a variety of domains, including learning and memory. The neural underpinnings of these cognitive deficits, however, are poorly understood. Based on evidence that abnormal functioning of brain dopamine (DA) systems is implicated in both schizophrenia and mechanisms of reinforcement processing, we proposed to test theories of the functional role of dopamine in schizophrenia. Specifically, the studies described here test two main ideas about DA function and its possible contribution to SC: 1) its role in facilitating learning of cue-reward associations; and 2) its role in signaling mismatches between expected and experienced outcomes (called prediction errors).||Study Population:||In order to assess brain responses to outcomes, and cues predictive of outcomes, we will enroll 135 total participants (SC patients and controls), aged 18 - 55. For a first set of experiments, we enrolled 54 total subjects (37 SCs and 17 controls) to achieve 34 total completers (24 SCs and 10 controls). In a second set of experiments, our goal is to examine two types of SC patients (those taking clozapine and those taking a different second-generation antipsychotic). For these experiments, we will enroll 81 total subjects (27 controls, 27 SCs taking clozapine, and 27 SCs taking a different second-generation antipsychotic) to achieve approximately 47 total completers (15 controls, 16 SCs taking clozapine, and 16 SCs taking a different second-generation antipsychotic).||Design:||We will measure brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in conjunction with the performance of reinforcement processing tasks from the literature. These paradigms involve either the passive observation of reinforcement contingencies, or the requirement to make an appropriate response within a time window in order to earn positive feedback. The ongoing study uses two specific paradigms: one examining the impact of brain responses to feedback on subsequent learning, and one investigating how brain responses to a monetary reinforcer are modulated by the unexpectedness of the event.||Outcome Measures:||In the current study, we will investigate differences in MRI responses to outcomes between SC patients and controls, and between subgroups of patients. In particular, we are interested in determining whether MRI responses in components of reward circuits, such as the midbrain, basal ganglia, and orbitofrontal cortex, are attenuated in SC patients, in the context of paradigms that require individuals to detect mismatches between expected and experienced outcomes, and to modify responses based on those mismatches. We hypothesize that learning deficits in SC stem primarily from impairments in the signaling of errors in reward prediction, and that abnormalities in the signaling of errors in reward prediction will be reflected in abnormal stimulus-evoked activation in the primarily in two brain areas in SC patients (both DA target areas): prefrontal cortex and the neostriatum. We predict that these signals will relate systematically to performance on a reinforcement-learning task., Classical Conditioning|fMRI|Schizophrenia|TD Model|Incentive Salience
2	Efficacy Study of GAÏA Program Cognitive Remediation of Facial Affects Processing in Schizophrenia, Purpose:||Rationale:||Social cognition impairments was highlighted for persons suffering with schizophrenia by numerous studies. The use of treatment programs intended to treat specifically these deficits through procedures of cognitive remediation, will allow decreasing their impact on everyday life by improving abilities to understand and interact with others. Such tools could allow also profits in terms of reduction of positive and negative of schizophrenia. The Gaïa program is intended to improve the perception of the facial affects which is one of social cognition processes impaired in schizophrenia.||Methods:||This is a multicenter, randomized, controlled study comparing people aged 18 to 45 years with a diagnostic of schizophrenia according to the DSM-IV-TR.||The Gaïa program will be compared to an already validated neurocognitive remediation program, training attentional processes (RECOS).||100 patients will be randomized as follows:||Arm 1,Experimental: Gaïa (20h with therapist, computer assisted method)||10 week-treatment, with 2 sessions of 1 hour per week, and 1 homework exercise without therapist per week.Individual therapy.|Gaïa exercises were designed by B.

0	Interventional Study of Anxiety Symptoms in the Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) Patient, This study is an interventional study of patients with ICDs followed in the Cleveland Clinic Device Clinic. Patients with ICDs experience some level of anxiety which can impact the number of shocks that they receive from their Device. 100 of these patients will be randomized into one of 2 groups; those receiving three sessions of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and those receiving usual care. We hypothesize that if these ICD patients receive short term (CBT) they will experience less anxiety and have a lower rate of device firings than the patients that did not receive CBT. Furthermore, we will study mechanistic pathways involved in the reduction of anxiety in ICD patients. We will extract initial heart rate variability (HRV) data from device interrogation. We hypothesize that the CBT intervention arm will have a higher normalization of HRV. Patients will repeat questionnaires at 3, 6 and 12 months., Anxiety|Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD)|Defibrillators, Implantable

2	Exploratory Cognition Study of Sertindole in Patients With Schizophrenia, Cognitive deficits, including impairments in areas such as memory, attention, and executive function, are major determinants and predictors of long-term disability in schizophrenia. At present, available antipsychotic medications are relatively ineffective in improving cognition. However, scientific discoveries during the past decade suggest that it may be possible to develop medications that are effective in improving cognition in schizophrenia.||One of the important reasons to focus on cognitive deficits as a target for pharmacological treatment, is the association found between cognitive impairment and social dysfunction observed in patients with schizophrenia. Pervasive cognitive deficits have a limiting effect on the quality of life of patients with schizophrenia including social interaction and problem solving, community living, and employment prospects., Schizophrenia

2	Assessing a WeChat-based Integrative Family Intervention (WIFI) for Schizophrenia, The investigators will conduct a type 2 hybrid effectiveness-implementation study to test both the effect of and the implementation process of a WeChat-based integrative family intervention (WIFI) program. The program will include three core components: 1) psycho-education through WeChat Official Account (WOA), 2) peer support through WeChat chat group, and 3) professional support through WeChat video chat. A rigorous stepped wedge cluster randomized trial will be used to evaluate the implementation, effectiveness, and cost of the WIFI program. The WIFI program will be implemented in 12 communities affiliated with the Changsha psychiatric hospital through the free medicine delivery process in the 686 Program. 20 families of schizophrenia will be selected from each community. The 12 communities will be randomized to one of four fixed sequences every two months during an 8-month intervention period in four clusters of 3 communities each. All clusters will receive the usual financial benefit of the Reward Policy as the control condition, and then successively and in random order, will cross over to the WIFI program at 2-month intervals until the study ends. Outcomes will be assessed for both family caregivers and the family member with schizophrenia. Family caregivers will be assessed for their knowledge and skills about caregiving, social support and coping, perceived stigma, caregiver burden, family functioning, positive feelings, and psychological distress. Schizophrenia individuals will be assessed for their symptoms and functioning, quality of life, recovery and re-hospitalization. Cost data such as costs of the intervention, health care utilization, and costs associated with lost productivity will also be collected. In addition, the investigators will collect process data including fidelity and quality of program implementation as well as users' attitudes will also be collected. Treatment effects will be estimated using generalized linear maximum likelihood mixed modeling (GLMM) with clusters as a random effect and time as a fixed effect. Cost-effectiveness analysis will be performed from the societal perspective using incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Qualitative analysis will use the grounded theory approach and immersion-crystallization process. All statistical analyses will be conducted according to the intention-to-treat principle., Schizophrenia|Family intervention|WeChat|Stepped wedge|Psycho-education|Peer support|Professional support
2	The Impact of the Covid-19 Pandemic on Schizophrenia Patients Registered With the Community Mental Health Center, The study was conducted on patients registered to the Ministry of Health Kartal Dr. Lütfi Kırdar City Hospital Adatepe Community Mental Health Center and was followed up regularly. It was carried out on 108 individuals who met the diagnosis of schizophrenia according to the DSM-V (American Psychiatric Association 2013) and met the inclusion criteria. Individuals who were respectively classified as hospitalized group (HG) during the Covid-19 pandemic period (n=39), non-hospitalized with emergency care group (NHECG) without hospitalization (n=37), and non-hospitalized with non-emergency care group (NHNECG) (n=32). Individuals who had been diagnosed with schizophrenia for at least two years, were not in the active phase of the disease, did not have organic mental disorders, did not have any other psychiatric diseases were included in the study. In the study, the Socio-Demographic Questionnaire, the Calgary Depression Scale in Schizophrenia (CDSS), the Buss-perry Aggression Questionnaire (BPAQ), and the Suicide Probability Scale (SPS) were used., 0
2	A Comparison of the Pharmacokinetics and Safety of Long-acting Injectable Risperidone When Administered to Gluteal or Deltoid Intramuscular Injection Sites in Stable Schizophrenia Patients., This is a randomized, open label, single dose, multicenter, 2-way crossover study comprising a screening phase, 2 open-label treatment periods, and end-of-study evaluations. The study population will comprise patients with chronic stable schizophrenia. Patients will be allowed to continue on their existing oral antipsychotic treatment throughout the study, if not receiving disallowed mediations, per protocol. Patients will be randomly allocated to receive treatment in 1 of 2 panels. In each panel, patients will receive a single intramuscular injection of long-acting injectable risperidone in each treatment period, in a 2-way crossover design. In Panel I, patients will receive 25 mg long-acting injectable risperidone via the gluteal muscle and 37.5 mg long-acting injectable risperidone via the deltoid muscle during the study period. In Panel II, patients will receive 50 mg long-acting injectable risperidone via the gluteal muscle and 50 mg long-acting injectable risperidone via the deltoid muscle. There will be a washout period of 85 days between each administration of study drug. The primary outcome will be comparison of the pharmacokinetic parameters area under the curve (AUC) and peak plasma concentration (Cmax) for 37.5 mg deltoid versus 25 mg gluteal, and for 50 mg deltoid versus 50 mg gluteal. Safety will be assessed at screening, throughout the open-label treatment phase, and at the end of study or early withdrawal using a combination of adverse events (including occurrence of extrapyramidal symptoms as assessed by the Extrapyramidal Symptoms Rating Scale), clinical laboratory tests (hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis, and pregnancy testing), vital signs, physical examinations, electrocardiograms, and injection site evaluation. The study hypothesis is that intramuscular injections of long-acting injectable risperidone via the gluteal and deltoid sites will be bioequivalent routes of administration, as measured by peak and total drug concentrations in the plasma, and that the safety and tolerability profiles of the 2 injection sites will be comparable. The patients will receive a single injection of long--acting injectable risperidone (25 mg, 37.5 mg or 50 mg) in their gluteal or deltoid muscle in 2 treatment periods., Schizophrenia|Risperidone|Long-acting injectable|Intramuscular injection|Pharmacokinetics

2	Safety Study With Paliperidone ER Extended-Release (ER) Tablets in Geriatric Patients With Schizophrenia, Paliperidone is being developed as a new therapeutic agent for the treatment of schizophrenia. The ER formulation of paliperidone was developed to deliver paliperidone at a relatively constant rate over a 24-hour period to improve the tolerability profile and decrease the potential for orthostatic hypotension. Typically, elderly persons with schizophrenia respond well to antipsychotic drugs. However, medications should be administered cautiously and usually at lower starting dosages than those prescribed for younger patients, with care taken to balance efficacy and tolerability. Flexible dosages of paliperidone ER have been chosen for this study to better achieve this balance and more closely mimic clinical practice. This is a multicenter, double-blind (neither the patient nor the physician will know if placebo or drug is being given and at what dose), randomized (patients will be assigned to different treatment groups based solely on chance), placebo-controlled, parallel-arm study. The primary purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of flexible doses of paliperidone ER in patients with schizophrenia who are 65 years of age or older. The study consists of a screening phase of up to 5 days, a 6-week double-blind treatment phase, and an optional 24-week open-label treatment phase. For administrative purposes, the screening and the double-blind treatment phases are referred to as R076477-SCH-302 and the open-label treatment phase is named R076477-SCH-702. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive paliperidone ER or placebo. At the time patients enter the double-blind period, they must be hospitalized for a minimum of 14 full days. Those patients who receive paliperidone ER will start at a dosage of 6 mg taken daily, which may be titrated up to a maximum of 12 mg or down to a minimum of 3 mg daily based on the patient's safety and tolerability of the drug. Patients who complete the 6 weeks of double-blind treatment, or who finish at least 21 days of treatment and discontinue because of lack of efficacy, may enter the 24-week open label treatment phase. While patients are hospitalized, efficacy will be assessed twice during the first week and at the end of the second week. Efficacy will be evaluated throughout the 6-week double-blind phase by completion of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Clinical Global Impression Scale - Severity (CGI-S), Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP), Schizophrenia Quality of Life Scale, Revision 4 (SQLS-R4), and Sleep Visual Analog Scale (VAS) during the double-blind treatment phase. The efficacy variable will be measured by the change from baseline score for PANSS, CGI S, SQLS-R4, Sleep VAS, and PSP. Safety will be monitored throughout the study based on incidence of adverse events; measurement of extrapyramidal symptoms using 3 rating scales (Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale [AIMS], Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale [BARS], Simpson-Angus Rating Scale [SAS]); measurement of vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate); electrocardiograms; and clinical laboratory tests. Double-blind phase: paliperidone ER will be flexibly dosed in the range 3 to 12 mg (3, 6, 9, or 12 mg/day) orally once a day or matching placebo, for 6 weeks.||Open-label phase: The starting dose is 6 mg/day for 7 days; thereafter, flexible oral dosage of paliperidone ER (3, 6, 9, or 12 mg/day) for 24 weeks., schizophrenia|geriatric|elderly

2	Peer-led Psycho-education for Schizophrenia, Objectives: This study is to test the effectiveness of a peer-expert-led psycho-education group programme for Chinese outpatients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders over an 24-month follow-up. The program is an integrated,psycho-education program that addresses patients' knowledge and self-management of schizophrenia and problem-solving skills. Methods: A single-blind, multi-site randomized controlled trial will be conducted with 342 Chinese patients with schizophrenia in Hong Kong, China and Taiwan. In each of three study sites, the participants will be randomly selected from the eligible patient list (i.e., 114 subjects from each study site) and after baseline measurement, be assigned to either the peer-led psycho-education program, profession-led psycho-education group, or usual psychiatric care. The patients' mental and psychosocial functioning, insights into illness, and their re-hospitalization rates will be measured at recruitment and at one week, and 6, 12 and 24 months after completing the interventions. Hypothesis: The patients in the peer-led psycho-education program will report significantly greater improvements in their symptoms and re-hospitalisation rates (primary outcomes) and other secondary outcomes (e.g., insight into illness and functioning) over the 24-month follow-up, when compared with those in profession-led psycho-education group and/or usual care. Conclusions: The findings will provide evidence whether the peer-led psycho-education group program can better improve Chinese schizophrenia sufferers' psychosocial functioning and reduce their illness relapse., peer expert or specialist|psycho-education|schizophrenia|outpatients
0	Evaluation of Parturients With Anxiety, Maternal prenatal anxiety has been shown to have implications on neonatal behavior and early childhood behavioral and emotional wellbeing. Recent studies found that adults using computer-assisted feedback-learning paradigms, referred to as Cognitive Bias Modification for Interpretation (CBM-I), experienced significant reductions in levels of social anxiety, trait anxiety, and depression. Our goal is to identify patients with prenatal anxiety and evaluate the effects of CBM-I on symptoms of prenatal anxiety and patient satisfaction with the labor and delivery experience., 0
1	Comprehensive Collection, Charting, and Communication System, Project Summary: SymTrend is seeking funding to bring low-cost, technology-afforded power and efficiency to the special education (SPED) of a lower functioning child with autism (LFCA). Each LFCA has a federally mandated, individualized education plan (IEP). An effective IEP requires intensive school and home-based behavioral monitoring: iterations of behavioral data recording, progress charting, and team communication. SymTrend will extend the functionality of its current Internet and mobile system for behavioral monitoring to include the use of digital pen technology for recording on specially printed forms. The project will then test the two types of electronic monitoring (iPod Touch and digital pens) against current pencil and paper monitoring. It is hypothesized that an electronic system with four components - i.e., forms creation, data collection, progress charting, and team communication - will reduce the time burden of behavioral monitoring and enable schools to meet the IEP needs of its students within the constraints of very restrictive educational budgets.||Objectives: The three objectives of this project are 1) to design and implement a four-component behavioral monitor for IEPs that is easy-to-use, cost-sensitive, and has the power and efficiency to optimize and sustain behavioral improvement in LFCA; 2) to incorporate functionality for an extensive range of a) learning contexts, b) types of behavioral measurement, and c) progress charting formats that meet IEP reporting requirements; and 3) to contrast electronic behavioral monitoring with standard paper methods in terms of: a) efficiency, b) power, and c) acceptance.||Design and Methods: The test of the system will include a sample 15 children participating in one of two public school systems. LFCA will be monitored by parents and more than one type of professional both at school and at home. Monitoring will occur in the context of skill learning and disruptive behavior elimination. Professionals will keep track of their time and effort doing behavioral recording, charting, and communicating with other members of the IEP team. The research design includes within-subject comparisons of baseline paper monitoring versus electronic monitoring in terms of efficiency, power, and acceptance.||Significance: The electronic behavioral monitoring system created to support IEP use with LFCA can also be used with higher functioning children with autism (HFCA), other developmental disabilities (e.||g., ADHD), other clinical uses (e.g., depression and anxiety), academic use (e.g., university level behavioral science) and commercial use (e.g., human factors studies)., Autism|Behavioral Observations|Electronic diaries|Professionals treating children 3-10 with lower functioning autism

2	Social Cognitive Assessment in Autism and Schizophrenia, The project's objectives are: (1) to assess relevance of ClaCoS in schizophrenia and autism compared to healthy controls, and to analyze links between social cognition and both neurocognition and symptoms, (2) to collect data in a large sample of healthy controls in order to establish appropriate standards for tools composing ClaCoS battery.||For the first objective, three kind of evaluation will be proposed: clinical, neurocognitive and social cognitive (ClaCoS). Three populations of 80 participants will be compared: healthy controls, patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorders, and patients with autism spectrum disorders. These three groups will be matched on sex, age and level of education.||For the second objective a systematic collection of data will be carried out in a large sample of healthy controls. In this part of the study, only social cognitive measures will be recorded. Subjects will be ranked according to three criteria: three classes for age (18-25 years old, 26-35 and 36-45), five classes for socio-professional status according to the INSEE classification, and two classes for sex (men/women)., schizophrenia

1	The Virtual Mindfulness Study, It is well recognized that autistic individuals experience high rates of mental health issues, but that needed mental health services are often inaccessible. There is some evidence to suggest that mindfulness-based therapies may help to reduce some of these challenges for autistic adults. While in person interventions may be helpful, there are also benefits to participating in virtually based interventions, particularly during the pandemic. Virtual groups have the added benefit of not requiring travel for people who have difficulties with travel because of anxiety or financial constraints. For some autistic individuals, virtual engagement can be preferred over in person interactions because of the flexibility that virtual interactions allow (camera on or off, communicating with text or speaking, being able to attend from home in a familiar and comfortable space).||In a prior CAMH led study, the investigators demonstrated that autism-informed adaptations to a standard mindfulness-based virtually delivered group intervention led to self-reported improvements in mindfulness, self-compassion, and distress, with changes maintained at three months follow-up. This prior study lacked a control group, however so it is not known whether the positive impacts reported were specific to the mindfulness-based intervention itself or to other factors. Building on this previous work, there is a need to study whether improvements are also evident when compared to individuals who do not take part in the intervention.||The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of a virtual group mindfulness intervention for autistic adults on their mental health and well-being, compared to a group who has not received the virtual group intervention. Specifically, the investigators will compare change across multiple indicators of mental health and well-being for participants, post-intervention, and at 15 weeks follow-up, to participants in a waitlist control group who have not yet received the intervention.||Study Design: Randomized controlled trial with waitlist control.||Hypotheses We expect that participants in the mindfulness-based intervention group will report improvements in self-reported distress (primary outcome), mindfulness, self-compassion, and sense of autistic belonging (secondary outcomes), relative to the waitlist control group, which will be maintained at 15 weeks follow-up.||Survey Evaluation: All participants will provide pre, post and follow-up survey data related to either a 6-week virtual mindfulness course or waitlist. Participants will fill out survey measures evaluating the impact of either the intervention or waitlist on distress levels, self-compassion, mindfulness, and connections from baseline (Time 1) to week 7 (Time 2) and week 15 (Time 3). In addition, the waitlist control group (Group B) will be offered virtual mindfulness intervention from week 16 to week 21 and will be asked to complete 2 additional set of questionnaires at week 22 and at week 30, thus providing data pre and post with follow-up related to the mindfulness intervention.||Study Setting: This study will be delivered virtually but will be offered through CAMH, Toronto.||Target Population We aim to recruit in total 80 autistic adults from across Canada., 0

0	Reducing Anxiety and Stress in Primary Care Patients, Background/Rationale: Many Veteran primary care patients experience impairing symptoms of anxiety, but rates of treatment are low. Primary Care-Mental Health Integration (PC-MHI), in which mental health clinicians provide brief treatment in the primary care setting, can bridge the gap between demand for, and availability of, anxiety treatment. However, brief anxiety interventions suitable for use in the PC-MHI setting are needed. Developing an effective brief PC-MHI intervention for anxiety would address a gap in VA treatment options and facilitate high quality healthcare that improves treatment engagement, clinical outcomes, and patient experience. To ensure maximum reach, this intervention should accommodate a variety of subthreshold and diagnostic anxiety presentations, as well as comorbid depression.||Objectives: The overall goal of this research program is to develop, refine, and evaluate a brief anxiety intervention that will be acceptable to Veterans and feasible for PC-MHI providers. The primary aim of the current study is to conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial to evaluate feasibility, acceptability, potential implementation barriers and facilitators, and effectiveness of the intervention compared to usual care.||Methods: This will be a pilot hybrid type I effectiveness-implementation randomized controlled trial (N = 35). The primary goal is to evaluate feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of the intervention in reducing anxiety symptom severity compared to usual care. The secondary goal is to collect preliminary data on implementation barriers and facilitators that may affect future real-world uptake., anxiety|primary health care|Veterans
2	A Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Study of the Safety and Efficacy of Paliperidone Extended Release (ER) in the Treatment of Schizophrenia in Adolescent Patients, The study is a multicenter, randomized (treatment group is assigned by chance), double-blind (neither the physician nor the patient knows which treatment group the patient is in), parallel-group, placebo controlled study. This study will enroll adolescent men and women who have schizophrenia as specified by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; 4th Edition (DSM-IV) diagnosis of schizophrenia (295.10, 295.20, 295.30, 295.60, and 295.90) as confirmed by the Kiddie-Sads-Present and Lifetime Version (KSADS-PL), and who should have a Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) score that is between 60 and 120, inclusive, at screening and baseline. Before any study related procedure is performed, the patient and his parent or legal guardian must have provided assent and signed an informed consent form, respectively. The study consists of 3 phases: a screening phase, a 6-week double-blind treatment phase with an end-of-study or early withdrawal visit, and a 1 week follow-up visit for patients who do not enter the optional open-label safety study. In the screening phase, a trained clinician will complete the K SADS-PL interview, including all 5 supplements, to confirm the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia. In addition, the K-SADS-PL screening diagnostic interview items for suicide must each have a score of <=2, as follows: item a), recurrent thoughts of death; item b), suicidal thoughts; item c), suicide attempts and their seriousness; item d), suicide attempts and their lethality; and item e) self harming behavior. Women of childbearing potential will undergo a urine pregnancy test at screening, baseline, Week 4, and at end of study or upon early withdrawal from the study. Patients who are receiving prohibited medications, such as antidepressants, lithium, drugs of abuse, and alcohol, will enter a washout period during which medications will be tapered down and eventually stopped. The screening and washout phase may not exceed 21 days. In the double-blind treatment phase, at the baseline visit, the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be reviewed. Patients who continue to meet the criteria will be randomly assigned (as in the toss of a coin) to 1 of 4 dose groups. Patients weighing between 29 to <51 kilograms (kg) will receive paliperidone ER 1.5, 3.0, or 6.0 milligrams (mg) or matching placebo. Patients weighing >=51 kg will receive paliperidone ER 1.5, 6.0, or 12.0 mg or matching placebo. Patients will come to the study site for weekly visits during this phase. A follow-up visit will occur 1 week after the end of treatment for those patients who will not enter the open-label study. Efficacy and safety procedures will be performed at specified times during the study. Efficacy procedures include the administration of the PANSS, Children's Global Assessment (CGAS), Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) and a sleep visual analog scale. Safety assessments include a physical examination (ECG measurements, vital signs, weight, height, and waist measurements), clinical laboratory testing, drug screen, Simpson and Angus Scale (SAS), Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS), Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS), Tanner Staging, concomitant medications and the recording of adverse events. A Data Safety Monitoring Board will oversee the conduct of the study and review adverse event reports and laboratory test results. The total volume of blood drawn for laboratory evaluation throughout the study, including 10 milliliters (mL) for the optional pharmacogenomics testing, is approximately 66 mL for each patient. Blood samples will be collected to explore the pharmacokinetics of paliperidone in adolescent patients. The study hypothesis is that at least 1 paliperidone ER dose group will be superior to placebo in improving the symptoms of schizophrenia as measured by the change in total PANSS score from the baseline to endpoint (Week 6). Paliperidone ER 1.5, 3.0, 6.0, or 12.0 mg or matching placebo will be administered daily in the morning before 10 a.m., and at approximately the same time each day. Study drug administration should occur in a consistent manner relative to the intake of food (i.e., either before or after breakfast, or without any breakfast) throughout the study. Study drug should be swallowed whole and with water. Study drug will be administered for 6 weeks., Schizophrenia|Antipsychotic

1	T-ABA Group Based Early Intervention For Parents of Children With ASD, This is a ten week study. The child will be randomized to one of two treatment groups. Assignment is chosen by chance (like flipping a coin). The two treatment groups are T-ABA (Targeted Applied Behavior Analysis) with parent training and T-ABA with parent training and individual child sessions. For both groups, study procedures will be the same except the T-ABA with parent training and individual child sessions group will receive eight one-to-one Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) individual therapy sessions during the course of the study. Participants in the T-ABA with parent training group will be offered eight one-to-one ABA individual therapy sessions at the conclusion of the study.||During the child's participation in this study families are asked to not make any changes to his or her current neuropsychiatric medications or therapy for two weeks before the study begins and during his or her ten week participation. Medication changes may include increasing or decreasing the dose you receive, changing the time of day the child takes medication, starting a new medication, or discontinuing a current medication. Therapy the child receives may include speech, OT, PT, counseling, play therapy, music therapy, social skills training, special education services, socialization, recreational sports, or nutritional interventions. Therapy changes may include increasing or decreasing how often the child receives therapy, changing who the child receives therapy from, beginning a new therapy or discontinuing a current therapy.||The child will be asked to complete assessments before the start of the study. The child will complete a language assessment and an eye tracking task that will measure his or her attention to different pictures and videos. Families will complete questionnaires that examine the child's medical and family history as well as his or her current symptoms, functioning, and quality of life and families will be given a language collection device. This is like a recorder that will record every time the family or the child talks. Families will place the language collection device in the pocket of the child's clothing and it will record the language environment for two days. Families will return the language collection device to us. To help us better understand your child's medical condition, we will access the child's medical records to collect any previous evaluations and diagnoses.||During weeks 1 through 4, families will attend a parent training group. Each group will be 1.5 hours long and will focus on topics such as discrete trial teaching (breaking skills into small components in order to teach new information to the child), natural environment teaching (using the environment to increase the child's motivation to communicate), assessing and treating challenging behavior, using visual supports and teaching everyday living activities such as drinking from a cup or washing hands. During these groups families will have the opportunity to view examples and practice using the skills discussed.||During week 5, families will attend a parent training group. Families and their children will also be observed and videotaped by study staff for 10 minutes during which they will be asked to use the techniques you learned during the parent group. The video tape will be kept in the child's study file and will only be viewed by study staff as part of the research study. Families will also complete questionnaires that examine the child's medical and family history as well as his or her current symptoms, functioning, and quality of life and will be given a language collection device (like a tape recorder). They will place the language collection device in the pocket of the child's clothing and it will record his or her language and language environment for 2 days. They will return the language collection device to us.||During weeks 6 through 9 families and their children will attend a one-hour weekly parent-therapist session with a study staff member. They will practice using the techniques from the parent group with their child and the study staff member will provide them with coaching and feedback. Families can also bring along specific questions they have.||During week 10, families will attend a parent-therapist session. Families and their children will also be observed and videotaped by study staff for 10 minutes during which they will practice using the techniques from the parent group with their child. They will also complete questionnaires that examine the child's current symptoms, functioning, and quality of life and they will be given a language collection device. They will place the language collection device in the pocket of the child's clothing and it will record his or her language and language environment for 2 days. Families will return the language collection device to us. The child will also complete testing with a study staff. Testing will measure the child's language and attention to pictures and videos during an eye tracking task.||Ten weeks after the study is complete, families and their children will complete the same assessment procedures that were completed during week 10 in order to measure any changes that occurred after the end of the study.||If a family is in the T-ABA with parent training and individual child sessions group, the child will also receive one-to-one ABA therapy sessions during weeks 1 through 4 and 6 through 9. During the one-to-one ABA therapy sessions the child may work with the therapist on skills such as making eye contact when his or her name is called, playing with toys, asking for favorite foods or activities using words or gestures, making choices, taking turns or responding to one-step commands. Study staff will work with families to select programming to be completed with their child during these sessions.||If a family is in the T-ABA with parent training group, they will be asked if they'd like to schedule eight one-to-one ABA therapy sessions at the conclusion of the study (after follow-up assessments have been collected).||Families will receive assessment results in a brief report provided after testing is completed at visits 1, 5, 10 and follow up., Autism|Applied Behavior Analysis
2	A Study of Effectiveness and Safety of Paliperidone Extended-release (ER) Tablets in the Prevention of Recurrence in Adult Patients With Schizophrenia., Paliperidone ER is currently being investigated as treatment for the acute symptoms of schizophrenia and also as maintenance treatment. This trial is designed to evaluate efficacy and safety of paliperidone ER in prevention of recurrence of psychotic symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. This trial is a randomized (patients will be assigned to different treatment groups based solely on chance), double-blind (neither the patient nor the physician will know if placebo or drug is being given and at what dose), placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study consisting of 5 phases: a screening phase of up to 5 days; a 8-week open-label run-in phase, during which all patients will be treated with open-label, flexibly dosed paliperidone ER (3 to 15 mg) orally once daily to identify a dose that will achieve control of their acute psychotic symptoms (only patients who maintain a stable dosage regimen and have a total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale [PANSS] score </=70; Clinical Global Impression Scale - Severity [CGI-S] </=4; and scores of </=4 for PANSS items for delusions, conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behavior, suspiciousness/persecution, hostility, and uncooperativeness during the last 2 weeks of the run-in phase will be eligible to continue in the stabilization phase); a 6-week open-label stabilization phase, patients who maintain control of their acute psychotic symptoms at the paliperidone ER dosage identified during the run-in phase and meet the total PANSS score, CGI-S, and PANSS items scores throughout the stabilization phase will be randomized to receive either flexibly dosed paliperidone ER, starting at the dose maintained during the stabilization phase of the study, or placebo; a double-blind treatment phase of variable duration, during which patients will be followed until they meet either defined criteria for recurrence or the study ends; a 52-week open-label extension phase for patients who experience a recurrence event during the double-blind phase of the study, or who remain recurrence free for the entire double-blind phase of the study. Efficacy will be assessed using the PANSS and CGI-S scores that will be collected every week, every 2 weeks, or every 4 weeks throughout. Safety assessments include the incidence of adverse events throughout the study; measurement of vital signs (orthostatic pulse rate, orthostatic blood pressure, and temperature); and clinical laboratory tests. In the run-in, double-blind, and open-label extension phases of the study, paliperidone ER or matching placebo will be flexibly dosed in the range 3 to 15 mg orally once a day (3, 6, 9, 12, or 15 mg/day). The dosage in the stabilization phase will be fixed throughout at the dosage that achieved symptom control in the run-in phase., Schizophrenia|paliperidone|Risperidone

2	Efficacy of Bifeprunox in Patients With Schizophrenia, Schizophrenia is a serious and disabling mental disorder that affects approximately 1% of the world's population. There are a number of antipsychotic drugs in use but none is ideal, in particular because their safety profile is complex and their effectiveness is limited. In particular, after having overcome acute exacerbations many patients continue to experience significant symptoms that prevent an adequate functioning. In the current study, patients suffering from schizophrenia and currently in a post-acute maintenance phase of the disease will be included. Non-treatment resistant patients will be included in the study, since they have partially responded to their current antipsychotic treatment but still have clinically significant symptoms and/or impairment of functioning in their daily life. The study is a 12-month study with an initial 12-week placebo-controlled, quetiapine-referenced phase. After this initial 12-week phase, the patients allocated to placebo will be switched to bifeprunox. In the final non-inferiority analysis of the 12-month data, the results from this study will be combined with the data from a similar study (11916A)., Schizophrenia|Antipsychotic|Bifeprunox

2	An Efficacy and Safety Study of One Dosage of Paliperidone Extended Release (ER) in Treating Patients With Schizophrenia, Currently, treatment of acute symptoms in schizophrenia is less than ideal, up to one-third of patients with schizophrenia do not respond to current treatments, and poor drug tolerability can decrease a patient's ability to remain on treatment. Paliperidone ER doses in the range of 3 mg/day to 12 mg/day have been approved for the treatment of patients with schizophrenia. A lower dosage form of paliperidone ER be efficacious and may reduce the risk of certain adverse effects. This study will evaluate the efficacy of 1 fixed (ie, it does not change during the study) dosage of paliperidone ER (1.5 mg/day) compared with placebo. One fixed dosage of paliperidone ER (6.0 mg/day) will be given to some patients as an active (it has already been shown to have efficacy) control. This is a multicenter, double-blind (neither the patient nor the study-site personnel know which treatment the patient is receiving), randomized (patients are assigned to a treatment group by chance), placebo-controlled (some patients will receive placebo and no active drug), parallel-group (patients in all groups follow the same study design) study in adults who were diagnosed with schizophrenia at least 1 year before screening and who are experiencing an acute episode. The study starts with an up-to-5-day screening phase to find out if the patient is eligible for the study. The screening phase includes a 3- to 5-day washout (the medication dosage is tapered down and finally stopped) of any medications that are being taken by a patient but that are not allowed during the study. A 6-week double-blind treatment phase follows and finishes with an end-of-study visit. A post-study visit to collect additional safety data will be scheduled for 1 week after a patient receives his or her last dose of study drug. The length of the entire study is about 8 weeks. Patients who withdraw from the study before completing the double-blind treatment phase will complete the end-of-study visit procedures at the time they withdraw and the post-study visit 1 week after receiving their last dose of study drug. For all patients leaving the study, the investigator will make every effort to see that they receive adequate continuity of care. At baseline (the visit just before a patient takes the first dose of study drug), all patients will be randomly assigned to 1 of the 3 possible treatment groups to receive paliperidone ER 1.5 mg/day, paliperidone ER 6 mg/day, or placebo once daily for 6 weeks. Patients must be voluntary inpatients at the time of randomization, and they must remain in the hospital for a minimum of 8 days. Efficacy will be measured using the following rating scales: the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S), the Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP), and the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form Health Survey-36 (MOS SF-36). Safety will be evaluated using physical examinations, ECGs, clinical laboratory testing (hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis), testings for pregnancy, and monitoring for adverse events including extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) using the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS), Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS), and Simpson-Angus Rating Scale (SAS). The study hypothesis is that Paliperidone ER at 1.5 mg per day will be effective in the treatment of schizophrenia as measured by the change in total PANSS score between baseline and endpoint in comparison with placebo. Oral paliperidone ER 1.5 mg or 6.0 mg tablets or matching oral placebo tablets taken once daily in the morning for 6 weeks., Schizophrenia

0	Anxiety Self-Management for ICU Patients Receiving Mechanical Ventilation, A three group randomized trial with repeated measures. Participants are assigned by chance to one of three groups: 1) patient-directed, as desired music listening through headphones, 2) noise-canceling headphones only, or 3) usual care. Participants remain in the study, up to 30 days, as long as they are receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICU, choose to withdraw, or become unable to complete the daily anxiety assessments. Information is collected daily on patient-perceived anxiety levels (visual analog scale & State Anxiety Inventory), ventilator settings, and all medications received. Urine is collected each day the participant is on the ventilator to determine level of stress (cortisol) if the kidneys are functioning appropriately and the participant is not receiving medications known to influence cortisol levels.||Mechanical ventilation is a common treatment for respiratory problems for patients in the ICU. Patients receiving mechanical ventilation experience much anxiety and distress from the placement of the endotracheal tube (breathing tube) and the mechanical ventilator itself. The usual treatment for these symptoms are medications, which are very potent and have numerous adverse side effects, removing patient involvement and control from managing these symptoms. Music has been shown to decrease anxiety and promote relaxation in limited, single listening intervention studies with patients in the ICU on ventilators. This study tests whether having patients listen to preferred music (familiar & comforting) whenever feeling anxious and wanting to relax for as long as they would like to listen to music through headphones throughout the entire time they are on the ventilator can improve outcomes such as less anxiety, shorter time on the ventilator, receipt of fewer medications, and less stress when compared to patients who do not listen to music while they are on the ventilator. Results from this study will advance nursing science by providing evidence on the efficacy of a simple, self-directed intervention that the millions of patients who receive mechanical ventilation each year in the ICU can use themselves to treat the very common symptoms of anxiety and distress. Results from this study will expand the knowledge base of adjunctive interventions that can be implemented in the ICU to involve patients directly in managing their own symptoms, ultimately improving patient outcomes.||Patients who are alert and can provide consent are invited to participate if they are on the ventilator in one of the participating ICUs. Patients remain in the study for as long as they are on the ventilator (up to 30 days) and can provide daily assessment of their anxiety levels. Patients are free to withdraw, however, at any time. Patients randomized to music receive an assessment of their music preferences by a professional music therapist. The music therapist then develops a music collection for each participant, based in individual preferences, that is kept at the bedside throughout the duration of being on the ventilator. The music therapist also visits with music participants' daily to determine if preferences have changed and if he/she desires additional music compact disks (CDs) to be kept at the bedside. Data is collected from the medical record on all medications and ventilator settings each day the participant is enrolled in the study. All urine is collected each day the participant remains in the study if the kidneys are functioning properly and the participant is not receiving medications known to influence cortisol, a marker for an integrative level of stress., Ventilator|chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|Anxiety
2	Glycine and D-Cycloserine in Schizophrenia, To determine if glycine produces improvement in negative symptoms and D-cycloserine produces worsening in symptoms compared to placebo, patients will undergo a double blind study of d-cycloserine and glycine treatment added to clozapine.||Clozapine is more effective for negative symptoms of schizophrenia than conventional neuroleptics, but the neurochemical actions contributing to this superior clinical efficacy remain unclear. Recent evidence points to a role for glutamatergic dysregulation in schizophrenia, as well as important differences between conventional agents and clozapine in effects upon glutamatergic systems. D-cycloserine, a partial agonist at the glycine modulatory site of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, improves negative symptoms when added to conventional agents and worsens negative symptoms when added to clozapine. High-dose glycine also improves negative symptoms and has provided preliminary evidence suggesting that glycine improves negative symptoms when added to clozapine. Serum concentrations of glycine predicted response to both high-dose glycine and D-cycloserine. Both clozapine and D-cycloserine may improve negative symptoms by activation of the glycine modulatory site of the NMDA receptor complex. Because D-cycloserine is a partial agonist, it may act as an antagonist at the glycine site in the presence of clozapine, whereas the full agonist, glycine, would not be expected to worsen negative symptoms in the presence of clozapine.||This study proposes to administer a fixed-dose of D-cycloserine, glycine, or placebo added to clozapine in 45 patients with schizophrenia. Because assessments are standardized between studies, results from this study can be compared with results from a previous study of D-cycloserine added to conventional neuroleptic.||The study was ultimately suspended before participants were enrolled, due to definitive findings indicating that pairing treatment of D-cycloserine with Clozapine resulted in worsening of negative symptoms., Adult|Amino Acids|Cycloserine|Female|Glycine|Human|Male|N-Methylaspartate|Placebos|Schizophrenia|Amino Acids -- blood|Cycloserine -- *therapeutic use|Glycine -- *therapeutic use|Schizophrenia -- *drug therapy|Schizophrenia -- physiopathology

2	iTBS on Negative Symptoms and Cognitive Function in Schizophrenia, The negative symptoms and cognitive deficits are two core symptoms in patients with schizophrenia, and do not respond well to antipsychotics. There are many researches on the biological mechanism of these two symptoms, and some studies indicated that these two symptoms maybe related to the dysfunction of prefrontal cortex and deficiency of dopamine. rTMS is a safe and non-invasive physical treatment, some studies has been indicated that the high frequency rTMS could increase the excitability of cortex, and has potentials to improve negative symptoms and cognitive function in schizophrenia.Therefore, this study explore the efficacy of iTBS on negative symptoms and cognitive deficits in schizophrenia based on identifying the brain network connection of schizophrenia symptoms.||Firstly, we have used neuroimaging to find the left prefrontal cortex that is responsible for negative symptoms and cognitive function in schizophrenia. Then,we design this randomized double-blind sham-controlled clinical trial. Patients with schizophrenia will be randomly treated with iTBS or sham condition to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex(L-DLPFC) for continuous 10 days, theL-DLPFC will be targeted utilizing the localite neuronavigation system. The follow-ups are set at baseline, the 11th day and the 30th day after the end of treatment.

0	Neurofunctional Predictors of Escitalopram Treatment Response in Adolescents With Anxiety, The long-term goal of this study is to explore the neurobiological basis of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) using a validated functional MRI (fMRI) paradigm and functional connectivity analyses with a cohort of GAD patients and healthy subjects and generating feasibility and preliminary data regarding treatment-related effects of escitalopram on brain functional activation and Fc patterns in pediatric GAD. An additional goal is to identify biological markers in saliva and urine that will predict treatment response in pediatric subjects with GAD. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that core dysfunction within the prefrontal-amygdala network, which the investigators and others have observed in GAD, will be normalized by successful treatment. The rationale underlying this hypothesis is that, despite the high prevalence of GAD, there is a need to understand its neurobiology and to identify biomarkers of treatment response and the mechanisms by which selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) putatively effect changes in the neurocircuitry of pediatric GAD., Anxiety|Adolescents with Anxiety

2	Schizophrenia and Physical Exercise, Schizophrenia is a serious mental disease characterized by a combination of positive and negative symptoms, and it is associated with social and occupational dysfunction. The positive symptoms reflect an excess or distortion of normal functions (delusions, hallucinations and disorganized behavior), whereas the negative symptoms are related to flattened affect, alogia, avolition and decreased cognitive function. One recent study reported that schizophrenia is associated with distortions of reality, changes in perceptions and thoughts, difficulties in social situations and problems with daily functions.||Schizophrenia generally appears at the end of adolescence or at the beginning of adulthood and affects approximately 1% of the population. The disease has a deteriorating course and does not involve large neurological changes. Its etiology may be explained by interactions between factors associated with genetic susceptibility and adverse environmental factors. Recently, it has been hypothesized that alterations in neuroplasticity may be an important factor for the development of schizophrenia.||IGF-1 is an important growth factor that induces neuroplasticity (neuronal survival, cell differentiation, cell proliferation, synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis). Schizophrenic patients have lower serum IGF-1 levels than healthy individuals. Because IGF-1 levels are lower in schizophrenic patients and this is associated with the etiology of the disease, it is important to investigate treatments that may increase serum IGF-1. Antipsychotic drugs such as olanzapine stimulate the phosphorylation of AKT, which is part of the main downstream pathway of IGF-1. It is possible to activate AKT through several intracellular signals and receptors, including activation of the insulin receptor (IR). However, activation of the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) appears to be the main activator of AKT phosphorylation.||In addition to antipsychotic medications, resistance exercises may be another way to increase IGF-1 concentrations. This type of physical exercise has been growing in popularity in society. In recent years, evidence has shown benefits from this exercise for different age groups in both healthy and sick individuals, and it has been indicated to augment bone mineral mass, strength and muscular mass; to prevent or treat sarcopenia; to decrease frailty and functional impairment; and to improve cognitive function and hypertension, among other benefits.||Studies conducted with the young and the elderly who underwent resistance training have shown increased serum IGF-1 levels. However, studies showing the effects of resistance training on schizophrenia and serum IGF-1 levels have not been performed. Studying resistance training is important for several reasons. Importantly, it is a low-cost treatment that may be a possible therapeutic tool, not only to increase IGF-1 concentrations but also to decrease disease symptoms, especially negative symptoms, and the side effects of antipsychotic drugs (extrapyramidal effects, weight gain and tiredness), which may improve quality of life. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of 20 weeks of resistance training on psychotic and depressive symptoms, quality of life and serum IGF-1 concentration., Physical exercise|IGF-1|Schizophrenia|neuroplasticity

1	Brain Plasticity of Autism in Response to Early Behavioral Intervention: A Multimodal MRI Study, Autism is a well-recognized neurodevelopmental disorder severely affecting the health of children. While the unclear neurobiological basis of autism and the lack of effective medication, the most commonly used approach for treatment is behavioral intervention. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the intervention therapy remains incompletely understood. The current project aims to explore the impacts of different early behavioral intervention methods on brain plasticity of autism using multimodal MRI technique and provide guidelines for the intervention and treatment of autism by evaluating the efficiency of these methods. Investigators first investigate longitudinal effect of behavioral intervention on brain structure and function in children with autism. In addition, investigators provide new biological indexes upon multimodal large-scale brain connectomes to evaluate the curative effect of intervention. Finally, investigators propose a prediction model of intervention effect based on multimodal multivariate pattern analysis methods. Furthermore, investigators expect to map the state-of-the-art biomarkers on multi-modal networks to provide a new interpretation of pathophysiological mechanisms of autism., autism|Brain Plasticity|Behavioral Intervention|Magnetic Resonance Imaging

2	"Once Weekly D-cycloserine for Schizophrenia, In a previous placebo-controlled trial, investigators demonstrated significant improvement of negative symptoms with once-weekly D-cycloserine treatment. In addition, investigators found significant improvement of memory consolidation following the first dose; however, the effect on memory consolidation was lost after several weeks. The ""practice effect"" of weekly measurement of memory consolidation using repeated administration of the Logical Memory Test may have resulted in a ""ceiling effect"" which would obscure drug/placebo differences. In the current study, investigators propose to administer the Logical Memory Test at four-week intervals (weeks 1, 4 and 8) to avoid the ceiling effect. Additionally a measurement will be added of negative symptoms at week 4 to better characterize the time course of negative symptom improvement.||Hypotheses:||Assess the effects of a single dose of D-cycloserine 50 mg on memory consolidation as measured by the Logical Memory Test compared to placebo.|Assess the persistence of once-weekly D-cycloserine effects on memory consolidation measured at weeks 4 & 8.|Assess the effects of repeated weekly dosing of D-cycloserine on performance on a standard cognitive battery at week 8 compared to placebo.|Assess effects of weekly D-cycloserine dosing on negative symptoms at weeks 4 & 8 compared to placebo.|Assess tolerability and side effects of weekly D-cycloserine compared to placebo., Cognitive Impairment|Neuroplasticity|D-cycloserine|N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)|Anti-Bacterial Agents|Mental Disorders|Psychotic Disorders|Antitubercular Agents|Schizophrenia and Disorders with Psychotic Features|Schizoaffective Disorder"
1	Sensory Integration Therapy in Autism: Mechanisms and Effectiveness, Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are among the most common neurodevelopmental disorder with estimated costs of treatment across the lifespan of $3.2 million. A common feature of ASD is over or under sensitivity to the environment and difficulty putting sensory information together in an orderly way, referred to here as sensory issues. Such sensory issues are now included in the diagnostic criteria in the DSM5 under the Restrictive and Repetitive Behaviors and Interests Criteria. These sensory issues have a deleterious effect on functional skills and limit participation in work, education, and social activities for individuals with ASD and their family. Building on previous work, this study seeks to extend understanding of Sensory Integration Therapy (SIT) as a non-invasive intervention to improve functional skills in children with ASD and sensory issues, and to test its efficacy in comparison to commonly used applied behavioral treatments. Further, the investigators will explore the proposed neurobiological mechanisms by which this intervention may work, and phenotypic moderators of outcome. This study utilizes a randomized trial to compare SIT to a commonly used behavioral intervention to evaluate outcomes on functional skills as a basis for improved independence over the lifetime. A total of 180 children with ASD and sensory issues in the greater New York City Metropolitan area will complete this study., 0

2	The Effect of a Community-based LAI-treated Management Model on the Violence Risk of Patients With Schizophrenia, This is a 12-month open-label randomized controlled study. Patients with schizophrenia and violence risk under the government supervision will be enrolled in the study. A community-based long-acting antipsychotics-treated management model will be applied to the experimental group, which means that professional psychiatrists will provide guidance to primary-level mental health workers on the psychotic treatment, and monthly-injected long-acting antipsychotic, paliperidone palmitate, will be used in the schizophrenia treatment. Every subject in experimental group will be equipped with an intelligent robot capable at push-to-talk and push-to-view, allowing the patients and caregivers to contact doctors for assistance at any time, if they are able to use smart phones.||The subjects in experimental group will be injected with 150mg eq and 100mg eq paliperidone palmitate in the deltoid at the 1st and 8th day, and afterwards a flexible dose of paliperidone palmitate from 75 to 150mg eq will be administrated monthly according to clinical judgement. Previous oral antipsychotics could be continued or withdrawn in 2-4 weeks after first paliperidone palmitate administration according to doctors' clinical judgement. Doctors have rights to decide whether a patient needs in-hospital treatment or extramural hospital treatment. The study protocol does not limit other medication or treatment measures except the injectable paliperidone palmitate. Other medication or treatment measures should be decided according to doctors' clinical judgement and negotiation with patients and guardians.||Subjects in control group will be treated with oral antipsychotics or other conventional medication., schizophrenia|violence risk|long-acting antipsychotics|community-based
2	A Study of Flexibly Dosed Paliperidone Extended Release Tablets in Participants With Schizophrenia, This is an open label (all people know the identity of the intervention), prospective (study following participants forward in time), non-randomized (the study drug is not assigned by chance, participants may choose which group they want to be in, or they may be assigned to the groups by the researchers), single-arm (getting one dose of medicine) and multi-center (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study) study designed to determine the efficacy, tolerability and safety of flexible dosage of paliperidone ER tablets in treatment of participants with schizophrenia not satisfied with other prior antipsychotics. The duration of the study will be 12 weeks. All participants will be given paliperidone ER 3 milligram (mg) or 6 mg or 9 mg or 12 mg oral (by mouth) tablets depending on Investigator's discretion once daily for 12 weeks; initial dose for paliperidone ER will be 6 mg/day.

This is a 52-week, outpatient, multicenter, flexible-dose, open-label extension study designed to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of SEP-363856 (25 to 100 mg/day) for the treatment of subjects with schizophrenia who have completed the Treatment Period of one of the two following double-blind studies: Study SEP361-301 or Study SEP361-302., schizophrenia
2	Therapeutic Efficacy of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in Schizophrenia, This study builds on the results of a previous phase 1, single-site study in which we demonstrated the safety of image-guided theta burst stimulation (TBS) form of rTMS over the cerebellar vermis (Demirtas-Tatlidede et al., 2010) in eigh patients with schizophrenia.||The primary goal of the present study is to assess efficacy of iTBS to the cerebellar vermis on positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. A second, added goal is to investigate the mechanisms of the expected clinical improvement.||Schizophrenia is a leading cause of mental disability and current treatments still remain only partially successful for many patients. Our underlying hypothesis is that modulation of the cerebellar vermis may enhance activity of the neural systems that sub-serve cognition and emotion, reestablish the disturbed cerebellar regulation in schizophrenic patients, and produce clinical improvement., Schizophrenia|repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation
2	Genes Polymorphisms and Metabolic Effects of the Second Generation Antipsychotic Drugs in Patients With Schizophrenia, SGAs now is used as the main tool to treat schizophrenia, however，the mechanism of glucose and lipid metabolism disorder it brings is still unclear. Based on the previous studies, the investigators found that the CB1 gene has a close connection with the metabolism disorder.The investigators suppose that the CB1 also has a significant role in regulation of energy and metabolism in hypothalamus. In this study ,the investigators will recruit 300 Patients with schizophrenia who defined by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-5 (DSM-5), aged 18 to 60,and all the participants will receive a 6-week systematic treatment by one of the SGAs(including olanzapine, risperidone oral solution, ziprasidone capsules), and a battery of assessments of treatment effect and safety. Plasma concentration will be tested regularly, and these genes polymorphisms of CB1 and other associated with energy metabolism will be conducted by the second generation of gene detection techniques.This study could provide evidence and data to achieve the aim of individualized medication, reduce the drugs' side effect, also throw light on the production of medication for correct the metabolism disorder., Genetic polymorphism|Metabolic side effects of drugs|schizophrenia|Second-Generation Antipsychotic|Cannabinoid Receptor Type 1
1	A Trial of CM-AT in Children With Autism With All Levels of FCT (The Blum Study), Autism is clearly a significant cause of disability in the pediatric population. Many children with Autism exhibit impaired protein digestion which may or may not manifest in self-restricted diets. The inability to digest protein affects the availability of essential amino acids in the body. CM-AT is designed to enhance protein digestion thereby potentially restoring the pool of essential amino acids. Essential amino acids play a critical role in the expression of several genes important to neurological function and serve as precursors to key neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine. CM-AT is a proprietary enzyme that is designed as a granulated powder taken three times daily., Autism
2	"Oral Versus Injectable Risperidone for Treating First-Episode Schizophrenia, Schizophrenia is a severely disabling brain disorder. People with schizophrenia often experience hallucinations, delusions, thought disorders, and movement disorders. Proper treatment of first-episode schizophrenia may increase the chances of controlling disease progression on a long-term basis. People experiencing their first episode of schizophrenia are more responsive to treatment than those with chronic schizophrenia, but are also more susceptible to adverse treatment side effects. Atypical antipsychotic medications have been shown to produce fewer adverse side effects than older ""typical"" antipsychotics. Risperidone is a type of atypical antipsychotic medication that is used to control the symptoms of schizophrenia. This study will determine the effectiveness of oral risperidone versus long-acting injectable risperidone in treating people with first-episode schizophrenia.||Participants in this open label study will be randomly assigned to receive either orally administered risperidone or long-acting risperidone administered via injection. Participants assigned to oral risperidone will receive medication in doses that are determined to be optimal by the study psychiatrist. Participants assigned to long-acting risperidone will receive an injection of risperidone once every 2 weeks. Dosages will begin at 25 mg and will be adjusted as necessary to achieve the optimal dosage. Following 2 to 3 months to achieve outpatient risperidone dosage stabilization, the randomized medication conditions will begin and participants will be monitored for 1 year. Study visits will occur once weekly throughout the study. They will include group therapy meetings focused on everyday living skills; family education about schizophrenia; assessments of medication response; and individual meetings with a case manager for counseling and evaluations of schizophrenia symptoms., Schizoaffective Disorder, Depressed Type|Schizophreniform Disorder|First-episode Schizophrenia|Injectable Risperidone"

2	Yoga as Cognitive Remediation in Schizophrenia, Cognitive impairment is a hallmark of schizophrenia (SZ). It affects the outcome of the disorder and markedly increases its burden. Various biological and psychological approaches are being tested to enhance cognitive capacity of these individuals, but the beneficial effects are modest. Yoga, the ancient Indian science of physical and mental fitness, offers a holistic approach to healthy life style and cognitive enhancement. Many studies have shown benefits of yoga for healthy individuals, and a few for psychiatric disorders. Despite its wide popularity, there are only a limited number of randomized, controlled yoga studies using objective quantitative outcome measures. Our preliminary studies have shown significant and substantial improvement in several domains of cognitive functioning among outpatients with SZ, using a simplified regimen in an open design. It is not clear if the benefits are due to physical activity alone or the entire yoga process per se. We propose to evaluate these results further, using a systematic random assignment design.||Explanatory model: The practice of yoga emphasizes body awareness and involves focusing one's attention on breathing or specific muscles or parts of body. We propose that the beneficial effects of yoga therapy (YT) observed in our preliminary studies relates to improvement in attention that extends to other cognitive domains.||Hypotheses:||Yoga enhances attention, as well as related cognitive function among persons with schizophrenia.|Yoga has beneficial effects on the short term functional outcome of schizophrenia.||Design: A systematic, single blind randomly assigned supplementation of routine outpatient training with yoga, compared with standard physical exercise and treatment as usual.||Specific Aims:||We propose to evaluate consenting outpatients with SZ undergoing treatment at the Department of Psychiatry, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research-Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital (PGIMER-RMLH), Delhi India (n= 258). Routine clinical management will be randomly supplemented with Yoga Training (YT, n = 86), directed Physical Exercise (PE, n = 86) or no supplementation (Treatment As Usual, TAU, n = 86).Treatment supplementation will last 21 days and all participants will be followed up for 6 months after completing supplementation.||1a. Recruitment: Both outpatients and inpatients at RMLH(Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital) with a clinical diagnosis of SZ, who fulfill inclusion criteria will be approached and written informed consent obtained.||1b. Diagnosis: All participants will complete an exhaustive evaluation based on the Hindi version of the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies (DIGS), supplemented with medical records.||Consensus diagnoses will be established using DSM IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) criteria.||1c. Randomization: The patients will be randomly assigned to one of the following three groups.||Group assignment and ratings will be carried out by different individuals to enable single blind evaluations. Three types of supplementation are planned over 21 days.||(i) Yoga Training (YT) (n = 86): Structured, simplified yoga instruction will be provided and supervised by a trained instructor in a group setting.||(ii) Physical Exercise (PE) (n=86): Structured, physical exercises supervised by a trained instructor.||(iii) Treatment as usual Group (TAU) (n=86): Participants who will continue in the department with clinical treatment as usual. No supplementation will be provided.||Clinical treatment, including pharmacotherapy will be carried out as usual in all three groups.

1	Divalproex Sodium ER in Adult Autism, Based on positive research with divalproex in children/adolescents with autism, we would like to extend this research to autistic adults with high levels of aggression, irritability, affective instability, or agitation. We aim to have 10 adult autistic patients enrolled in our study of the treatment of aggression/irritability with divalproex sodium ER. This will be an open treatment for adult patients to determine if the tolerability of divalproex sodium is better with the extended release. We propose this open label design because previous double-blinded studies of divalproex sodium were only done in children, not adults. These results will serve as pilot data for a future blinded study for autistic adults with the extended release formulation. This naturalistic design will allow for prior stable (3 months) use of concomitant medications. Our objective is to determine how well these patients can tolerate the prescribed doses and what added benefits can be attributed to divalproex sodium ER., autism|divalproex sodium ER|aggression|irritability
1	Parent Language Intervention for Autism, High dosage of early intervention is critical to language skill development in young children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and including parents is a cost-effective approach to maximize intervention dosage. However, parent-mediated interventions have inconsistent effects on parent and child outcomes. This variability is likely because parents do not have the same training as clinicians and little effort has been spent examining parent characteristics that may influence their ability to implement different types of intervention strategies. Given the known cognitive, personality and language features present among many parents of children with ASD, examining the relationship between learning styles in parents and their implementation of different parent-mediated intervention strategies is an important first step in identifying potential sources of variability in parent-mediated intervention outcomes. The objective of the proposed study is to examine how parent learning style influences parent use of language intervention strategies and subsequent child language skills. The central hypothesis is that the parent learning style will be associated with: (a) differential use of language intervention strategies and (b) child language skills. The specific aims include determining the extent to which: (a) parent learning style and type of parent-mediated intervention are associated with mother use of language intervention strategies and subsequent child language skills, (b) parent learning style moderates the relationship between intervention type and mother use of language intervention strategies, and (c) parent learning style is associated with their use of language intervention strategies and their children's language skills. The proposed study will enroll 108 children with ASD between 24 and 36 months of age and their mothers. Mother-child dyads will be randomly assigned to one of two parent-mediated intervention strategies that are contrasted in their theoretical approach (responsive-developmental, directive-behavioral). Mother-child dyads will be assessed before randomization (pre-test), after intervention (post-test) and 3 months after the end of intervention to monitor maintenance. Children in both groups will receive 8 weekly intervention sessions at home using the same experimental procedures. The proposed research is significant because it will be the first examination of the impact of parent learning style on both parent and child outcomes of two different parent-mediated intervention strategies (directive, responsive). Understanding the effects of parent learning style on parent use of intervention strategies and subsequent child language skills is a key step in customizing parent-mediated interventions based on parent characteristics. The long-term positive effect of the proposed research is to improve language outcomes of interventions for children with autism by tailoring parent-mediated interventions that capitalize on parental strengths., Language Intervention|Parent-Mediated Intervention
2	"A Study on Risk Mutations of Vulnerability Genes of Schizophrenia, 4a. Specific Aims. In our previous work based on a Taiwanese sample, we have found that schizophrenia was significantly associated with 11 candidate genes, including GNPAT (1q42.1), DISC1 (1q42.1), MRDS1 (6p24.3), NOTCH4 (6p21.3), NRG1 (8p21-p12), DAAO (12q22), G72 (13q32), CHRNA7 (15q14), PRODH (22q11.21), HMOXI (22q12), and CACNG2 (22q12). In this 3-year proposal, we have 5 specific aims, in which aim 1 is a continuation of our previous study of the Positional Cloning Study of SCH (POCOS) using family data, while aims 2 to 5 are newly developed research goals.||Specific Aim 1: To investigate tighter association of these 11 candidate vulnerability genes with different subtypes defined by clinical or endophenotype variables. The endophenotype variables include the neuropsychological functions of sustained attention measured by continuous performance test (CPT), executive function measured by Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WSCT) and the skin physiological function of niacin flushing responses.||The hypothesis to be tested is that schizophrenia is genetically heterogeneous and the specific risk SNP markers or specific risk SNPs haplotypes of different candidate genes will be associated with specific clinical subtype or specific endophenotype indicators with higher degree of statistical significance.||Specific Aim 2: To search for functional risk mutations of these candidate genes using direct sequencing technique, and to investigate the contributing genetic variance of the specific risk mutations in specific subtypes of schizophrenia, as mentioned in specific Aim 1, using case-control study design. The interaction effects of these functional risk mutations will be explored.||The hypothesis to be tested is that there are several specific risk mutations from 11 candidate genes. The contributing variances of these different risk mutations will be different.||Specific Aim 3: To find the variation of functional expressions of these identified risk mutations in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines of the patient subjects, and neuronal cell-lines.||We hypothesize that these candidate genes have expression discriminations when carrying risk mutations, which will be able to be detected from EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cells of these patients and neuronal cell-lines or from constructed reporter gene expression.||Specific Aim 4: To explore and clarify the candidate genes responsible for the impaired niacin skin flushing response in schizophrenia.||We hypothesized that difference in the skin niacin flushing response will reveals difference in the gene expression in the lymphocytes using microarray approach based on a matched case- control design.||Specific Aim 5: To establish a procedure to assess the prepulse inhibition function (PPI) in normal mice as the endophenotype indicator of schizophrenia, and test its validity with acute or chronic administration of amphetamine. This animal model will serve further functional study on the knock-out or knock-down mice carrying these identified risk mutations.||The hypothesis to be tested is that acute or chronic administration of amphetamine will block PPI in wild-type mice.||In addition, we will explore during the conducting of this proposal the following feasibilities: (1) To obtain human brain tissues for studying the functional expressions of these vulnerability genes with specific risk mutations; (2) To employ the animal model to assess neurophysiological and behavioral abnormalities in mice carrying the functional risk mutations; (3) To explore novel treatment for preventing the abnormal neurobiological process due to the risk mutations; and (4)To develop early detection and early intervention program, including genetic counseling, based on the data of risk mutations.||4. Research Plan (continuation) 4b. Background and Significance. Schizophrenia (SCH) is a devastating and stigmatized psychiatric disorder with high genetic loading. The identification of vulnerability genes of SCH is at dawn nowadays. As the vulnerability genes and the specific risk mutations are identified, there will come the revolutionary development in SCH research and clinical practice, including reliable and valid diagnosis based on genetic and related neurobiological data, novel treatment and early prevention of schizophrenia based on the knowledge of abnormal gene function and its interaction with the environmental factors.||The Genomic Psychiatry Study Group (GENOP), a multidisciplinary team of National Taiwan University Hospital, has been successfully operating in studying genetic factors in the psychopathology of SCH. This GENOP has carried out the positional cloning study on vulnerability genes of Schizophrenia (POCOS), supported by NRPGM in these 3 years, and has found 11 candidates vulnerability genes through dense SNP fine mapping study. This GENOP also have a thorough neurobiological and clinical psychopathological study (Hwu et al., 2002; Chen et al., 1998; Chiu et al., 2004; Hsieh et al., 2004; Hwu, 1999; Hwu et al., 2003). Thus, the GENOP is ready to take a step further to search for risk mutations of SCH as proposed here.||We conclude that the finding of vulnerability genes for schizophrenia is at dawn based on the following lines of empirical evidence:||Genetic Epidemiological Study SCH is a highly heritable disease, based on family, twin (Kendler KS 1983; Gottesman II 1993; Prescott and Gottesman II, 1993) and adoption (Heston 1966; Kety et al., 1968, 1994; Kendler et al., 1994) studies with an heritability of 0.70 (Tsuang et al., 1980, 1995; Guze et al., 1983; Kendler, 1988) and a λ, risk to first-degree relatives versus controls, value of 10 (Kendler KS, 1983; Gottesman II 1993; Prescott and Gottesman II, 1993; Chang et al., 2002). An oligogenetic model of SCH etiology was commonly accepted (Faraone and Tsuang, 1985; Risch and Baron, 1984; Vogler et al., 1990, Risch, 1990).||Molecular Genetic Studies of Schizophrenia 2-1. Linkage Analyses Genome-wide scans of SCH for the decade found that many chromosome regions had suggestive evidence for linkage (Coon et al., 1994; Shaw et al., 1998; Levinson et al.1998; Blouin et al., 1998; Kaufmann et al.1998; Faraone et al., 1998; Rees et al., 1999; Williams et al., 1999; Hovatta et al., 1999; Brzustowicz et al., 2000), whereas subsequent studies revealed a replication and non-replication pattern (Riley, 2000). Inadequate sample size and mixed ethnicity might be the major methodological problems (Altmuller et al., 2001, Hauser et al., 1996).||2-2. Candidate chromosome region approach A balance translocation (1; 11) (q42.1; q14.3) was found to be associated with major mental illness including schizophrenia (St Clair et al., 1990). The novel gene DISC1 at chromosome 1q42.1 was repeatedly found to have significant association with SCH, including our Taiwanese samples (Millar et al., 2000; 2001; Hovatta et al., 1999; Ekelund et al., 2001; Hwu et al, 2001; Ekelund et al., 2004, Liu YL et al., 2004).||2-3. Candidate gene approach Many candidate genes, such as dopamine (D1, D2, D3, D4, and D5), serotonin, and glutamate receptor genes, based on psychopharmacological hypothesis (Asherson et al., 1995, Breyler et al, 1995; Hranilovic et al. 2000; Catalano et al., 1993, Serretti et al., 1999; Chen et al., 1996, 1997), as well as developmental- and physiological-based genes such as neuron growth related genes (Margolis et al., 1994), phospholipase genes (Peet, 1998, Wei 1998), and a potassium channel gene (hKCa3/KCNN3) (Dror et al., 1999), have been reported to have association, though not consistently, with schizophrenia. The mixture of ethnicity in the sample may inflate the type I errors.||2-4. Association study using SNP fine mapping and family internal control method By genetic epidemiological guideline such as using linkage disequilibrium strategy and parent-offspring trios as internal control to guide the improved method to locate the susceptibility genes of complex disorder (Risch and Merikangas, 1996; Owen et al., 2000; Baron 2001), there were about 10 candidate genes found by using this modality of study approach (Elkin et al., 2004). These candidate genes included RGS4 (1q) (Mirnics et al., 2001), MRDS1 (6p24.3), DTNBP1 (6p22.3) (Straub et al., 2002; Tang et al., 2003; van Den Bogaert et al., 2003; van den Oord et al., 2003) , TNFa (6p22) (Boin et al., 2001; Pae et al., 2003), NOTCH4 (6p21.3) (Wei and Hemmings, 2000; Fan et al., 2002; Sklar et al., 2001; Skol et al., 2003; Takahashi et al., 2003), PPP3CC (8p21.3) (Gerber et al., 2003), NRG1(8p21-p12)( Stefansson et al., 2002; 2003;Yang et al., 2003) , DAAO(12q22) (Chumakov et al., 2002), G72(13q33) (Chumakov et al., 2002), CHRNA7(15q14) (Leonard S et al., 2002) , PRODH(22q11.21) (Liu et al., 2002; Jacquet et al., 2002) , COMT(22q11.21) (Shifman et al., 2002). Nevertheless, all these candidate genes still wait to be replicated in different study samples.||The GENOP of NTUH, by using dense SNP fine mapping method, have found that 8 significant candidate genes of MRDS1(6p24.3), NOTCH4(6p21.3), NRG1(8p21-p12), DAAO(12q22), G72(13q32), and PRODH(22q11.21), HMOXI (22q12), and CACNG2 (22q12) (Liu et al., 2004). This research team is thus ready to take a step further to search for the risk mutations of these candidate genes and the validation study of these risk mutations. Based on the meta-analysis of published studies, Altmuller et al (2001) and Risch et al.(2000) suggested that high density SNP association analysis in combination with functional genomic data may be necessary to detect susceptibility loci (which may be of small effect) for complex human disease, as shown in a few recent reports (Emamian et al., 2004; Mukai et al., 2004). This proposed RIGOS will follow this strategy as the main approach as shown in our specific aims.||Endophenotype indictors and Issue of Heterogeneity of SCH 3-1. Neurobiological Impairment in Schizophrenia SCH was found to have impairment in neuropsychological functions of executive function, sustained attention measured and working memory (Goldberg et al, 1993) with underlied frontostriatal dysfunction (Elliot et al., 1995), or dysfunction of frontal-temporal-limbic circuit (Gold and Harvey, 1993), or dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Weinberger et al., 1988; Berman et al., 1988).||These impaired neurobiological functions had significant association with specific clinical symptoms (Nuechterlein et al., 1986; Hain et al., 1993; Johnstone and Frith, 1996; Liu et al., 1997; Nuechterlein et al., 1986; Strauss et al., 1993; Nelson et al., 1998; Liu et al., 1997) and enduring long term disability (Weinberger et al., 1986; Goldberg et al., 1988).||SCH is characterized by core-deficits in information processing and attentional mechanism (Bleuler, 1911; Kraepelin and Robertson, 1919; McGhie and Chapman, 1961; Venables, 1964; Braff and Geyer, 1990), which was due to the impairment of ""filtering"" or ""gating"" function of brain (Braff and Geyer 1990). P50 event-related potential suppression (P50I) [Freedman et al., 1987; Olincy et al., 2000] and prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle reflex (PPI) (Braff et al., 2001; Geyer et al., 2001) are reliable measurements. Both P50I and PPI mechanisms, under different neuronal circuits (Swerdlow et al., 2001; Adler et al., 1998), are out of subject's will control, and both are impaired in the patients of SCH (Freedman et al., 1987; Braff et al., 2001), in the spectrum disorder of schizotypal disorder (Cadenhead et al., 1998; Cadenhead et al., 2000) and clinically unaffected relatives of SCH patients (Siegel et al., 1984; Waldo et al., 1988; Waldo et al., 1991; Adler et al., 1992; Clementz et al., 1998; Cadenhead et al., 2000). Both deficits in P50I and PPI can be as the endophenotype indicators with different neural substrate processes. In this study, we intend to use P50I and PPI as specific endophenotype indicator for identifying the possible responsible risk mutations of the possible candidate vulnerability genes.||Animal studies have shown that the PPI deficits could be induced pharmacologically by agents altering systems implicated in the neurobiology of schizophrenia, such as dopaminergic or NMDA glutamatergic neurotransmission (Mansbach et al., 1988; Hutchison & Swift, 1999). This experimentally induced PPI impairment by amphetamine has been conceived as a putative animal model with face, predictive, and construct validities for certain schizophrenic symptoms (Koch, 1999; Swerdlow et al, 2000).||Impairment of Niacin Skin Flush Response in Schizophrenia: The niacin induced vasodilatory response was either absent or impaired in schizophrenic patients (Horrobin, 1980; Wilson and Douglass, 1986; Fielder et al., 1986; Hudson et al., 1997; Rybakowski and Weterle, 1991; Hudson et al., 1997, 1999; Ward et al., 1998; Puri et al., 2001; Shah et al., 2000; Maclean et al., 2003). There is no significant relationship between antipsychotic drug dose and niacin sensitivity (Hundson et al., 1997; Messamore et al., 2003).||The niacin sensitivity may be through the nicotinic acid receptor HM74 (low affinity receptor) and HM74a (high affinity receptor) recently identified (Wise et al., 2003; Soga et al., 2003), and they are both Gi-G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR). The two receptors were expressed in the lymphocytes (Wise et al., 2003). The detail molecules and signaling pathway involved in niacin skin flush response still remained to be clarified. In this RIGOS project, it is desirable to explore the possible responsible genes in this un-studied area using microarray method.||3-2. Endophenotype Approach in Molecular Genetic Studies of Schizophrenia To face the genetic heterogeneity of SCH, an alternative strategy was to use specific neurobiological characteristic of the illness as an endophenotype reflecting the effect of a single genetic alteration (Lander, 1988). In this respect, deficits on the Continuous Performance Test (CPT) have been postulated to be a potential endophenotype of the genetic susceptibility to SCH (Chen and Faraone, 2000; Grove et al., 1991; Mirsky et al., 1995; Chen et al., 1998).||CPT deficit was a potential endophenotype of the genetic susceptibility to SCH (Chen and Faraone, 2000; Grove et al., 1991; Mirsky et al., 1995; Chen et al., 1998).||This endophenotype strategy has been successful in mapping of a neurophysiological deficit, decrease of P50 inhibition, to loci at chromosome 15q13-14 (Freedman et al., 1997). The other neurobiological deficit, eye-tracking dysfunction of schizophrenia has been mapped to chromosome 6p23-21 with the maximum multipoint lod score of 4.02 (Arolt et al., 1996). This RIGOS project will take this endophenotype strategy for validation of risk mutations, especially by using attention impairment measured by CPT as well as P50I and PPI indicators.||3-3. Issue of Heterogeneity Genetic and clinical heterogeneity is the main issue in this area of study. Searching for valid clinical subtype and endophenotype are critical for a breaking through study. Our GENOP group had substantial psychopathological data in this area and the RIGOS project will take this strategy.||Functions of Candidate Vulnerability Genes This RIGOS project will tackle on these 11 candidates vulnerability genes identified by our previous POCOS project. The neuronal functions of these 11 candidate genes to be studied have not been well characterized. Current knowledge on the functions of some of these 11 candidate genes are listed as the following: the GNPAT is a dihydroxyacetonephosphateacyltransferase (DHAPAT, or DAPAT) participating in the etherphospholipid biosynthesis (Ofman et al., 2001), the NOTCH4 is a heterodimer receptor involving in the vascular and articular cartilage development (Hayes et al., 2003; Iso et al., 2003), the NRG1 (neuregulin 1) is a group of isoform proteins produced from NRG1 gene by alternative splicing, these isomers interact with ERBB receptor and induce the growth and differentiation of neuronal and glial cells (Kerber et al., 2003; Fallon et al., 2004). The DAAO (D-amino-acid oxidase) is a peroxisomal enzyme activated by G72 (D-amino acid oxidase activator) (Chumakov et al., 2002). The CHRNA7 is a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit belonging to the superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels and involving in the development of the central nervous system (Agulhon et al., 1999; Raux et al., 2002). The PRODH (proline dehydrogenase) is an enzyme catalyzing proline to Δ-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C), the first step in the conversion of proline to glutamate (Harrison and Owen 2003; Lee et al., 2003). Deletion of this gene has been associated with hyperprolinemia (Jacquet et al., 2002). The functional roles of these genes on the neuronal cells warrant further investigation to predict the possible pathological process for schizophrenia. In this RIGOS project, we'll use in vitro cell-line to do functional laboratory study to validate any of these risk mutations identified in this RIGOS project., Schizophrenia|endophenotype|risk genetic mutation|vulnerability genes|affected sib-pairs|case-control design|animal model|functional validity|genetic epidemiological analysis"
